<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I
<br /><span class="small">&ldquo;I&rsquo;M AFRAID I&rsquo;M GOING TO LOSE MY LIFE&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>Peggy nudged Jo Ann and pointed to the sign
ahead: &ldquo;Speed limit, 80 miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann&rsquo;s dark brown eyes twinkled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s plain
to see we&rsquo;re out in the Texas open now&mdash;the wide
open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad poor old Jitters can&rsquo;t accept the invitation
to do eighty. She&rsquo;s doing well when she
makes forty or fifty. But even if she could go
faster, Florence wouldn&rsquo;t let her.&rdquo; Peggy gestured
toward the small, trim, fair-haired girl at
the wheel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence has lived in Mexico so long that
she&rsquo;s slow but sure like the Mexicans. She&rsquo;s always
saying, &lsquo;Why the great rush? There&rsquo;s plenty
of time!&rsquo; If I were driving, now&mdash;&rdquo; Jo Ann
nodded her mop of unruly black curls vigorously&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;d
encourage Jitters to go her limit,
especially since she has brand-new tires.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here too. Weren&rsquo;t we lucky to find such a
bargain in a car? I&rsquo;ll admit she&rsquo;s not much on
looks and that she shakes till she deserves the
name of Jitters&mdash;but she&rsquo;s ours, all ours.&rdquo;
Peggy&rsquo;s hazel eyes gazed admiringly upon their
old battered Ford.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And look where she&rsquo;s carrying us: to Mexico!
All the way to the land of mystery and romance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can hardly wait to get back down there
again. I wonder if we&rsquo;ll run into as thrilling
adventures as we did last summer when we were
visiting Florence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy smiled. &ldquo;You will. You&rsquo;re always getting
out of one mystery only to tumble headlong
into another.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>Jo Ann nodded toward the prim, erect, gray-haired
woman on the front seat beside Florence
and murmured, &ldquo;Miss Prudence&rsquo;ll keep me on
my good behavior this time. Even if some
tremendous mystery bumps right into me this
trip, I&rsquo;m not going to pay one bit of attention to
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Straight from Missouri am I,&rdquo; Peggy replied,
laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Mississippi, you mean. From a year&rsquo;s
hard work in good old Evanston High. The
work&rsquo;s agreed with us, hasn&rsquo;t it? We&rsquo;re both four
or five pounds heavier. School&rsquo;s agreed with
Carlitos, too.&rdquo; Jo Ann leaned forward to smile
at the round-faced eleven-year-old boy sitting on
the other side of Peggy. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s as fat as a butter
ball now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ever since the five had started on their long
automobile journey, Carlitos had been too busy
viewing the scenery to talk, but at Jo Ann&rsquo;s
words he opened his blue eyes wide and asked in
broken English, &ldquo;Butter ball&mdash;what is dat?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>Both Jo Ann and Peggy exchanged smiles. It
seemed strange to them that Carlitos could not
understand the most commonplace phrases, yet
when they stopped to think that he had spoken
Spanish altogether till he had come to the States
last fall, they marveled that he talked as well as
he did.</p>
<p>While Jo Ann was explaining to him the
meaning of the words &ldquo;butter ball,&rdquo; Peggy was
mentally reviewing his strange life. When he
was about a year old his parents had come from
New Jersey to a remote Mexican village where
his father, Charles Eldridge, owned a silver
mine. A few months later Mr. Eldridge had met
his death at the hands of a treacherous Mexican
foreman, and shortly afterwards Mrs. Eldridge
had died from the combined effects of shock and
pneumonia, leaving the tiny Carlitos in the care
of a poor ignorant Indian nurse. The foreman,
who had taken possession of the mine, then tried
to kidnap Carlitos, the rightful heir. Alarmed
at this threatened danger, the nurse had fled
across the mountains with Carlitos and her family
where they were befriended by Jo Ann,
Florence, and herself. Due to their efforts Carlitos&rsquo;s
uncle, Edward Eldridge, had been found
and the mine restored to Carlitos. So dismayed
had his uncle been at finding that his nephew
could not speak English that he had sent him to
Massachusetts to live with his aunt, Miss Prudence
Eldridge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>Peggy smiled to herself as her thoughts wandered
around to the New England spinster aunt
who had come down by train with Carlitos to
Mississippi and was accompanying them the rest
of the way to Mexico. Miss Prudence&rsquo;s never-ceasing
astonishment at having a half-grown
nephew who was just learning to speak English
was a source of amusement to her and Florence
and Jo Ann.</p>
<p>Just then Carlitos broke into an excited exclamation:
&ldquo;We come to big city! See&mdash;big high
houses!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; Jo Ann ejaculated. &ldquo;That must be
Houston. We&rsquo;ve made much better time than I
thought. We&rsquo;ll be there by seven o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>With a broad smile Peggy remarked low-voiced
to Jo Ann, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget that you drew
Miss Prudence for your roommate tonight. I
heard her say she always rises at five-thirty, so I
see where you&rsquo;ll have to get up with the
chickens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I have to get up at that ghastly hour, I&rsquo;ll
wake you and Florence, too. It&rsquo;ll be specially
good for you to get up early. As Miss Prudence
said last night, &lsquo;Remember, the early bird
catches the worm&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy made a funny little grimace. &ldquo;But I
don&rsquo;t want to catch worms&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to acquire a taste for them then,&rdquo;
Jo Ann retorted between giggles. A moment
later she added, &ldquo;We really ought to get an early
start tomorrow morning, sure enough, since we
may go by way of Brownsville.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On reaching the city a half hour later, they
drove straight to one of the larger hotels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just adore going into strange hotels,&rdquo; remarked
Peggy, starting to get out of the car.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>Miss Prudence turned in time to see her rising
and said quickly, &ldquo;You girls wait here while I go
in and look around. One can&rsquo;t be too particular
about the kind of hotel one chooses, even to stay
for a few hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Disappointed, Peggy dropped back into her
seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Peg, when we get to Mexico
she&rsquo;ll let Florence and us take the lead, since
she&rsquo;s never been there before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few minutes the girls saw Miss Prudence
returning, followed closely by a porter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; she called out briskly to them.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve registered for us all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hurried them on inside the hotel and into
the elevator so rapidly that Peggy declared
afterwards that she wouldn&rsquo;t have known she
was in a hotel if she hadn&rsquo;t seen a bellboy.</p>
<p>When the porter stopped at the first room and
asked which baggage he was to carry in, Miss
Prudence pointed to her suitcase, then hesitated
a half second.</p>
<p>Peggy grasped this opportunity to put in, &ldquo;Jo
says she&rsquo;s going to be your roommate this time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>Miss Prudence smiled over at Jo Ann. &ldquo;Fine.
Carlitos&rsquo;s room connects with ours; then you and
Florence have the one next to his. All of you
hurry and get cleaned up, now, so we can get
something to eat right away. Then we&rsquo;ll come
straight up and go to bed. We have to get an
early start in the morning, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three girls exchanged swift glances but
did not protest.</p>
<p>Once inside their room, however, Peggy
groaned loudly to Florence, &ldquo;Miss Prudence acts
as if we were still in rompers. Putting us to bed
as soon as we&rsquo;ve eaten our suppers! What&rsquo;s the
fun of coming to a new city if you can&rsquo;t see anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>By nine o&rsquo;clock, still inwardly protesting but
outwardly calm, the girls were marshaled back
to their rooms by Miss Prudence.</p>
<p>Jo Ann bade Peggy and Florence good night
and remarked with a teasing smile, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hear
me knocking at your door about 5:30 <span class="small">A.M.</span>&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare!&rdquo; both girls exclaimed in
the same breath. Florence added, &ldquo;Surely you
wouldn&rsquo;t be that cruel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I would. Misery needs companionship.
Be sure to leave the sliding panel of your
door down as it is now, so you can hear my first
tap.&rdquo; Jo Ann indicated the top section of the door
which was screened by a Venetian blind, as were
the doors of all the other rooms.</p>
<p>It seemed to Jo Ann she had hardly been
asleep two winks that night when she heard a
voice saying in her ear, &ldquo;Sorry, my dear, but it&rsquo;s
time you&rsquo;re getting up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Prudence! Surely it couldn&rsquo;t be morning!
She suppressed a groan and turned over
for another nap, only to hear the insistent voice:
&ldquo;Sorry, my dear, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann managed to mumble a sleepy &ldquo;All
right.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>After much stretching and yawning she reluctantly
slipped out of bed. She stood blinking
sleepily at Miss Prudence in her blue kimono
and thinking how Chinesey she looked with
her long, gray, braided pigtail down her
back.</p>
<p>Miss Prudence&rsquo;s next words were anything but
Chinese: &ldquo;Call the girls and Carlitos before you
start to dress. Both Peggy and Florence are
slower than you, and it&rsquo;ll take them a long time
to get ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of my clothes are in Peg&rsquo;s bag, so I&rsquo;ll
have to go in and get them before I can dress.
I&rsquo;ll wake them then.&rdquo; Thoroughly roused at
last, Jo Ann thrust her feet into her slippers,
slipped into her negligee, and started down the
hall.</p>
<p>Just as she reached the girls&rsquo; door a man&rsquo;s
earnest voice sounded startlingly clear through
the screened panel of the door directly across the
hall. Her heart gave a sudden frightened leap
at hearing someone say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m going to
lose my life before this is over.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>So distinct were the words that it seemed as if
the man were talking to her. In danger of losing
his life! And he was! There was no mistaking
the conviction in his voice. It was not the broken
trembling voice of a coward. It had been firm,
strong, even though he was sure he was in grave
danger. He must be talking to someone over the
phone&mdash;there was no audible answer. Why was
he in such terrible trouble? What had he done?
Was he a criminal or a detective?</p>
<p>Standing statue-like at the girls&rsquo; door Jo Ann
listened intently for his next words. &ldquo;I was hot
on their trail,&rdquo; the voice went on, &ldquo;but had two
flats, and that delayed me.... Yes, in the usual
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before she could realize that the conversation
had ended, the door opened suddenly, and a tall,
stalwart man wearing a broad-brimmed tan felt
hat stepped out. On seeing Jo Ann he halted and
shot a piercing glance at her from gray eyes so
penetratingly keen that she felt as if they were
cutting straight through her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>She flushed with embarrassment. It had been
unpardonably rude to eavesdrop that way. What
must that man think of her? Hurriedly she began
knocking on the girls&rsquo; door.</p>
<p>Out of the corner of her eye she saw that the
man, after hesitating a fraction of a second, had
gone on down the hall toward the elevator.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br /><span class="small">THE MYSTERY MAN</span></h2>
<p>After she had knocked several times, Peggy
called out sleepily, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open the door. Hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be there&mdash;in a jiffy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few moments Peggy flung the door open,
and Jo Ann stepped inside, her eyes still dilated
with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just heard the strangest&mdash;most mysterious
thing!&rdquo; she gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would!&rdquo; Peggy declared. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s
nothing unusual for you. You&rsquo;re always hearing
and seeing mysterious things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; Florence called from the bed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, just as I had reached your door and
was about to knock, I heard a man in the room
directly across the hall say in the most earnest
voice imaginable, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m going to lose
my life before this is over.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both girls stared wide-eyed at Jo Ann; then
Peggy, recovering from her first shock, asked
half doubtfully, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure you didn&rsquo;t misunderstand
him? Your imagination runs riot
now and then. Perhaps you just thought you
heard him say that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann shook her head vigorously. &ldquo;No imagination
about it. I heard him as distinctly as I
do you now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth made him say that, do you
suppose, Jo?&rdquo; Florence asked curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can that man be&mdash;a gangster?&rdquo; Without
waiting for an answer Peggy added, shuddering,
&ldquo;The idea of that man&rsquo;s being right
across the hall from us gives me the creeps.&rdquo; She
flew back to the door to see if she had locked it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe he must be a detective; I feel sure
he wasn&rsquo;t a gangster,&rdquo; Jo Ann said quickly. &ldquo;He
didn&rsquo;t look like one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You saw him!&rdquo; both girls exclaimed together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he came out of his door suddenly and
caught me standing there listening. I hadn&rsquo;t any
business eavesdropping&mdash;but I just couldn&rsquo;t help
it. I wanted to know why he thought he was
going to lose his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear him say anything else?&rdquo;
queried Peggy in a whisper, glancing back
toward the door as if she thought the man might
be doing some eavesdropping himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very much. Evidently he was talking to
someone over the phone. I couldn&rsquo;t hear anyone
answering. He said that he&rsquo;d lost the trail because
he&rsquo;d been delayed on account of two flat
tires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lost the trail!&rdquo; Florence repeated. &ldquo;That
sounds as if he&rsquo;s a detective, sure enough. Whom
do you suppose he was after?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s hard to say. I&rsquo;d have to use my imagination
to answer that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve certainly run into a real mystery this
time,&rdquo; put in Peggy, now thoroughly convinced
that Jo Ann&rsquo;s tale was not fiction. &ldquo;You ought to
have thought up some kind of a solution by&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sharp knock at the door broke into Peggy&rsquo;s
sentence, and all three girls gave little surprised
jumps and stared at the door without saying a
word.</p>
<p>The next instant Miss Prudence&rsquo;s voice called
out crisply, &ldquo;Girls!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s just Miss Prudence!&rdquo; Peggy exclaimed
in relief. &ldquo;I thought maybe that
man....&rdquo; She left her sentence unfinished and
ran to the door.</p>
<p>Jo Ann&rsquo;s face reddened guiltily. She had forgotten
entirely about dressing and telling the
girls to hurry.</p>
<p>As soon as Miss Prudence stepped inside and
saw that the girls were still in their pajamas, she
looked over reproachfully at Jo Ann and said,
&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d all be almost dressed by this
time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We would&rsquo;ve been ready, but....&rdquo; Jo Ann
rushed into an account of the strange telephone
conversation she had heard, ending apologetically,
&ldquo;I was so excited that I forgot all about our
having to dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as Jo Ann had finished, Miss Prudence
spoke up quickly, &ldquo;The sooner we get out of this
hotel the better. I don&rsquo;t like the idea of being in
a room across from a man that&rsquo;s expecting to
get killed any instant. Hurry fast as you can and
get dressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man&rsquo;s not in his room now: I saw him go
down the hall toward the elevator,&rdquo; Jo Ann reminded
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he might come back any minute, and
there might&mdash;well, something might happen.
Hurry, girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus urged, the girls dressed hastily. Even
Peggy, who usually was deliberate about arranging
her auburn hair into neat waves, speeded up
this part of her toilet and was dressed in record-breaking
time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>After they had been joined by Carlitos they
all went down to the coffee room for their breakfast
and then on out to the garage to get the car.</p>
<p>Jo Ann slipped into the front seat of the car
saying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my turn to drive Jitters this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sit with you to see that you don&rsquo;t go too
fast,&rdquo; Florence remarked smilingly, dropping
down beside her.</p>
<p>Jo Ann laughed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Jitters herself that&rsquo;ll
keep me from exceeding the speed limit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After they had left the city and had gone
several miles, Jo Ann noticed that in the automobile
just ahead of them were three men, one
wearing a uniform and the other two in civilian
clothes and large felt hats similar to the one the
mystery man had worn. &ldquo;The biggest one of those
men in that car ahead looks exactly like the man
I overheard talking this morning,&rdquo; she remarked
to Florence. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the same size and is wearing
the same kind of hat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>Florence smiled. &ldquo;It seems to me most of the
men I&rsquo;ve seen so far in Texas are big and wear
that kind of hat. You have that mystery man on
your mind: that&rsquo;s why you think you see a resemblance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe so, but I believe it&rsquo;s that very man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible that it is he, but&rdquo;&mdash;Florence
smiled&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m more interested in that man in the
uniform. I believe he&rsquo;s a traffic cop and is going
to get you for speeding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that sign!&rdquo; Jo Ann pointed to another
road sign indicating that the speed limit
was 80 miles. &ldquo;And now look at the speedometer.
I&rsquo;m going to let Jitters do her best now and pass
that car. I want to get a good look at that man
and see if it is my mystery man. I&rsquo;ll feel relieved
to know he&rsquo;s still alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann stepped on the gas and soon was swinging
out to the side of the road. As she passed by
the other car, she threw a swift but keen glance
at the largest one of the men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the mystery man!&rdquo; she exclaimed a
moment later. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s he. I certainly am
glad he&rsquo;s still alive.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>Florence relayed Jo Ann&rsquo;s words to Peggy,
whereupon Peggy craned her neck to stare out of
the rear window at the occupants of the car.
&ldquo;Where do you suppose they&rsquo;re going&mdash;to Mexico?&rdquo;
she asked Florence a moment later.</p>
<p>Florence shook her head. &ldquo;Ask me an easy
question. That&rsquo;s too hard for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew more about him. I wonder why
he&rsquo;s in such terrible trouble. I hope he&rsquo;s going
the same route we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s high time we&rsquo;re deciding whether we&rsquo;re
going by way of Brownsville or Laredo,&rdquo; Florence
called back, hoping that Miss Prudence
would catch the anxious note in her voice. She
and the other two girls had hinted very strongly
to her that they would like to take the longer
route, by way of Brownsville, so they could see
Lucile Owen, one of their schoolmates, but Miss
Prudence had so far refused to say definitely
whether she would be willing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to see Lucile,&rdquo; Jo Ann put in, loud
enough for Miss Prudence to hear, and adding
also for her special benefit, &ldquo;She says no one
really knows Texas till he&rsquo;s seen the Rio Grande
valley and its citrus groves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the most famous garden spot of Texas,&rdquo;
added Peggy.</p>
<p>The girls could see that Miss Prudence was
favorably impressed, but she still hesitated to
give her approval, saying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so far out of our
way&mdash;four hundred miles at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe if we keep singing the valley&rsquo;s
praises she&rsquo;ll give her consent,&rdquo; Florence prophesied,
low-voiced, to Jo Ann.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whichever way we go, I hope the mystery
man goes the same way,&rdquo; Jo Ann replied. &ldquo;I
want to find out more about him. Is his car still
following?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence turned around to see, then reported,
&ldquo;Yes, just a short distance behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several times afterwards Jo Ann asked that
same question, to have it answered each time in
the affirmative.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>By about two o&rsquo;clock she decided that they
must be nearing the road turning off to Brownsville.
&ldquo;Miss Prudence&rsquo;ll have to decide very
shortly now which way we&rsquo;re going,&rdquo; she told
Florence.</p>
<p>Evidently Peggy was thinking the same thing,
as the next moment they heard her appealing
again to Miss Prudence to decide on that route.
While Miss Prudence was still wavering about
her decision, Jo Ann drove past the Brownsville
road, but stopped as soon as Florence told
her she had seen the sign. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to decide
right now,&rdquo; she ended.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III
<br /><span class="small">THE HITCH-HIKER</span></h2>
<p>Just as Florence was speaking, she and Jo Ann
saw the car that had been following whiz by
them with only the two men in civilian clothes
in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there goes the mystery man!&rdquo; Jo Ann
exclaimed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going the Laredo road. I wish
I could follow and see if anything happens to
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Prudence spoke up quickly: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not
going to follow anybody who&rsquo;s expecting to be
murdered any minute. We&rsquo;d better go the
Brownsville road. Back to that filling station
and ask if the road&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>Jo Ann obediently backed the car to the filling
station, though a queer feeling now possessed
her that she ought to have kept on the Laredo
road. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help feeling as worried over that
man as if I&rsquo;d known him for a long time,&rdquo; she
told herself. &ldquo;I wonder if I&rsquo;ll ever see him
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time Miss Prudence was talking to
the service-station man about the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the road&rsquo;s okay, but&rdquo;&mdash;he nodded
toward a man in uniform&mdash;&ldquo;he&rsquo;ll know. He&rsquo;s a
coast guard and goes back and forth often that
way. He&rsquo;s waiting to catch a ride to Brownsville
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Prudence inspected the tall blond young
man closely, then remarked low-voiced, &ldquo;It
might be a good idea to have him go with us:
coast guards are used to protecting people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope she asks him to ride with us,&rdquo; Jo Ann
whispered to Florence. &ldquo;He might know about
the mystery man, since he&rsquo;s been riding in the
car with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next moment Miss Prudence gestured to
the coast guard, who promptly hurried over to
the car and in answer to her questions began
praising the road and the beauty of the valley.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Californians could learn how to boost higher
and better from him,&rdquo; Jo Ann thought, smiling.
&ldquo;Miss Prudence&rsquo;ll be sure to go now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was right. Miss Prudence promptly decided
to go to Brownsville and asked the coast
guard to accompany them. To make room for
him on the front seat, she ordered Carlitos and
Florence to exchange places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the sandwich filling now,&rdquo; Jo Ann
laughingly told Carlitos, as he slipped in beside
her.</p>
<p>Carlitos smiled doubtfully. From the expression
on her face he knew she must be joking, but
he could not understand the point.</p>
<p>After she had explained it to him, she told the
curious coast guard briefly how it was that Carlitos,
though an American by birth, was just beginning
to speak English. The guard, proud of
his newly learned Spanish, began talking in that
language to Carlitos, much to his joy and to Miss
Prudence&rsquo;s disapproval.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>At the first break in their conversation Jo Ann
quickly recounted to the guard the strange telephone
conversation she had overheard in the
hotel and ended tentatively, &ldquo;I believe that man
I overheard was one of those men whose car you
were in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re probably right,&rdquo; the guard replied.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d never seen either of those men before they
picked me up, but they told me they&rsquo;d been chasing
some smugglers who&rsquo;d been bringing in
dope and gold across the Mexican border. I
shouldn&rsquo;t like to be in those men&rsquo;s shoes. Those
smugglers belong to a desperate gang who&rsquo;re as
cold-blooded as snakes. They&rsquo;d as soon kill anyone
as not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With as many officers as we have, it looks as
if they could stop that smuggling,&rdquo; Jo Ann replied.</p>
<p>The guard shook his head. &ldquo;Easier said than
done. When we get to Brownsville, I&rsquo;ll show
you just one of the smugglers&rsquo; many tricks&mdash;how
some of the boldest bring dope and gold
across the bridge there, closely guarded as it is.
Smugglers have whole bags of such tricks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Be sure to show us that. It&rsquo;ll be interesting
to find out first hand about smugglers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though it was dark when they reached
Brownsville, Jo Ann reminded the guard of his
promise as he was about to get out of the car
near the International Bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;ll show you if you want to see,&rdquo; he
answered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s black as pitch under the bridge
now, and you&rsquo;ll get a better idea of how the
smuggling&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann turned to Miss Prudence and rapidly
explained that the guard was going to show them
how some of the smuggling was carried on across
the border.</p>
<p>Miss Prudence raised her eyebrows in disapproval.
&ldquo;I hardly think you girls need any information
along such lines. Of course, it&rsquo;s probably
a little interesting&mdash;in a way&mdash;to see how smuggling
could be carried on right under our custom
officials&rsquo; noses, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>Jo Ann smiled to herself. Miss Prudence was
as curious to know about smuggling methods as
she was. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll consent&mdash;after she objects a
while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann was right. Finally, after protesting a
few more minutes, Miss Prudence gave her permission,
and all five followed the guard below
the bridge. Blinded by the sudden change from
the lighted street, they stumbled along in the
darkness, half terrified at their daring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The river&rsquo;s very low now,&rdquo; the guard explained.
&ldquo;Anyone can manage to crawl down
the bank and get out a long way under the bridge
and hide. Just before the smuggler, coming
from the Mexican side, nears the appointed
place, he whistles his signal to his confederate
waiting under the bridge, then tosses his package
over the railing to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There might be some of those smugglers here
this very instant,&rdquo; Miss Prudence whispered
nervously. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They might think we&rsquo;re spying on them and
shoot us,&rdquo; added Peggy.</p>
<p>Jo Ann heard the amused note in the guard&rsquo;s
voice as he answered, &ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be any
smuggling going on this early in the evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s pitch dark,&rdquo; Miss Prudence put in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And terribly scary,&rdquo; added Florence, grabbing
Jo Ann by the arm. &ldquo;Come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even though Jo Ann was reluctant to leave
this fascinating spot, she too felt more comfortable
when they climbed back up the bank and
out on the lighted sidewalk again. Her thoughts
centered once more on the mystery man whose
work kept his life endangered by smugglers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he breaks up that gang of smugglers
without losing his life,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<p>After they had said good-by to the coast guard,
they went to the nearest hotel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first thing we&rsquo;ve got to do now,&rdquo; Jo Ann
said while they were being whisked up in the
elevator, &ldquo;is to phone Lucile and tell her we&rsquo;re
here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be sure to invite us to her house to
dinner tonight,&rdquo; put in Peggy, her eyes shining
with anticipation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it be nice to be together again?&rdquo;
added Florence.</p>
<p>As soon as Jo Ann had succeeded in getting
Lucile on the telephone, Peggy and Florence
listened eagerly to the one-sided conversation
and tried to guess the other side.</p>
<p>Lucile&rsquo;s eager voice came back quickly in answer
to Jo Ann with an invitation for all five to
spend the night at her home. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve arrived at
the right moment,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;Edna is visiting
me and I&rsquo;m having a little dinner party for
her tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann refused the first part of the invitation,
explaining that they had already secured their
rooms at the hotel. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be delighted to come
to your dinner party, though,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>Miss Prudence broke in quickly with an emphatic,
&ldquo;Tell her it&rsquo;ll be impossible for me and
Carlitos to come. I&rsquo;m too tired to go another step
anywhere. If they&rsquo;ll come after you girls and
bring you back, it&rsquo;ll be all right for you to go
without me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann relayed this message to Lucile, ending,
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be ready when you get here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV
<br /><span class="small">PRESSING DIFFICULTIES</span></h2>
<p>After Jo Ann had finished talking to Lucile,
Florence and Peggy asked together, &ldquo;Is it a real
party she&rsquo;s having? Will we have to dress up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ll have to wear dinner dresses, of
course. We&rsquo;ll have to speed, too, if we&rsquo;re to be
ready when she gets here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m afraid my blue cr&ecirc;pe&rsquo;ll be a mass
of wrinkles,&rdquo; Peggy exclaimed as she hurried
over and began unpacking her clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get my dress&mdash;the pink taffeta&mdash;out, too,&rdquo;
Jo Ann called out on her way to the bathroom.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in your suitcase. I&rsquo;ll have my bath in two
jiffies and be in my dress in another one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>When she reappeared in the room a few minutes
later, garbed in a negligee whose rose color
matched her fresh glowing cheeks, she found
that Miss Prudence and Carlitos had gone to
the dining room and that Florence and Peggy
were standing lamenting over the wrinkled state
of their dinner dresses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our dresses are terribly rumpled, and yours
is the worst of the three,&rdquo; Peggy remarked with
a worried frown. &ldquo;I hate for us to disgrace
Lucile by coming to her party looking like
wrecks of the Hesperus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t have time to send them out to a
pressing shop or even to the maid here in the
hotel&mdash;we&rsquo;d never get them back in time to
wear,&rdquo; added Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, stop worrying!&rdquo; Jo Ann sang out, as she
ran the comb through her curls. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll press all
three dresses while you&rsquo;re getting your baths.
You have a small electric iron in your bag, didn&rsquo;t
you say, Florence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. It&rsquo;s really a toy that I&rsquo;m taking as a
present to one of the little girls in my neighborhood.
The cord&rsquo;s so short&mdash;I doubt if you can
use the iron.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Get it out and I&rsquo;ll use it all right.&rdquo; Jo Ann&rsquo;s
voice was confident.</p>
<p>When Florence handed the iron to her and
she saw how short the cord was, she began to
feel dubious, though her determination did not
waver. She&rsquo;d manage some way. After a hasty
look about the room she saw there was only one
usable light socket in the room&mdash;the high ceiling
one above the bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to attach the iron to that socket.&rdquo;
She pointed to the ceiling light.</p>
<p>Florence looked at the diminutive cord and
laughed. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll hold me steady, you&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo; Jo Ann
climbed up on the foot of the bed. &ldquo;Hold my
legs, now.&rdquo; She stood tiptoe on this perch and
after many efforts succeeded in putting the plug
into one of the center sockets.</p>
<p>That done, she stepped down on a newspaper
on the bed, but to her disappointment she saw
that the cord lacked at least four feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>Peggy and Florence burst into giggles at the
funny sight of Jo Ann holding the iron in midair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop giggling, sillies, and do something,
quick. This iron&rsquo;s getting hot, and I&rsquo;m getting
tired holding it. Get that table over there and
put it up here on the bed. Hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two girls rushed over to the table, jerked
off the water pitcher and glasses, and then carried
it over and lifted it on top of the bed. The
iron still hung at least two feet above the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh gee!&rdquo; wailed Jo Ann. &ldquo;Get something
else to put on top of the table. Step on it! Don&rsquo;t
run around in circles like a puppy after its tail,
Peg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for the beautiful comparison,&rdquo; Peggy
grinned. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re equally funny looking yourself,
springing up and down on that bed every
time you move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t help springing. It&rsquo;s the springiest bed
in all Texas.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>By that time Florence had brought over the
low luggage stool and placed it on top of the
table. But even with its added height there were
several inches between it and the iron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing else to put on top of that&mdash;except
the dresser,&rdquo; called out Peggy between
giggles. &ldquo;Oh yes, maybe the telephone book&rsquo;ll
help.&rdquo; She ran over with it and several magazines
and piled them on top of the luggage
stand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attaboy!&rdquo; Jo Ann ejaculated triumphantly
as she set the iron down on the magazines. &ldquo;Now
bring me something for an ironing-board cover
and the dresses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few more minutes she was ironing away
energetically, swaying back and forth in her
efforts to keep her balance on the springy bed.
&ldquo;Stop staring at me and giggling and get dressed,
you sillies. What&rsquo;s so funny now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just wondering what the manager&rsquo;d
say if he&rsquo;d come in and catch you ironing,&rdquo;
grinned Peggy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s against the rules to iron in
a room&mdash;at least, it is in all the hotels I&rsquo;ve ever
heard of.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>Jo Ann flushed guiltily. Noticing that the
sliding wood panel of the door was down and
that someone might be able to peer between the
slats of the blinds at the screened top, she implored
Peggy to slide the panel up. Peggy
obediently pushed the panel up as commanded,
but no sooner had she turned away than it slipped
down with a crash like a pistol shot.</p>
<p>Both girls jumped in alarm, and Jo Ann almost
tumbled off the bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re in for it!&rdquo; Jo Ann gasped. &ldquo;Someone&rsquo;ll
think we&rsquo;re shooting in here and will
come to investigate. Shove that panel up again&mdash;quick.
Push a chair against it to hold it in
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a few minutes had passed and no one
had come to investigate, Jo Ann breathed more
freely. Just as she was complimenting herself on
coming to the finishing touches of her pressing,
there came a sudden knocking at the door. Jo
Ann was petrified. Was it the manager? She
shook her head vigorously at Peggy, who was
starting to open the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>The next moment the door was rattled violently.
Simultaneously the panel banged down
again.</p>
<p>From the hall there sounded a woman&rsquo;s shrill
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Prudence!&rdquo; the girls gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open the door this instant, Peg, and get her
inside before someone else comes,&rdquo; Jo Ann
ordered.</p>
<p>The moment Miss Prudence stepped inside
and saw Jo Ann perched on top of the bed, ironing,
she stared in amazement. As soon as she had
recovered from her first surprise, she burst out,
&ldquo;What does this mean? Don&rsquo;t you know it&rsquo;s
against the rules to iron in your room? I&rsquo;ve never
stayed in a hotel anywhere that allowed ironing
in the rooms. We&rsquo;ll get in trouble yet&mdash;besides
having to pay extra money. You&rsquo;d better stop
this instant.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m most through now,&rdquo; Jo Ann replied
meekly. &ldquo;In a few minutes I&rsquo;ll have my dress
finished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But just suppose the manager should knock
on the door and catch you on top of the bed like
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Miss Prudence was still worrying when
Florence had finished dressing, she decided to
see for herself what the hotel rules said about
ironing. She walked over and began glancing at
the printed rules hanging on the wall by the telephone.</p>
<p>A few moments later she stopped reading and
burst into peals of laughter. &ldquo;Oh, girls!&rdquo; she exclaimed
after she had checked her mirth a little.
&ldquo;This is rich! Funniest thing I&rsquo;ve ever heard.
The rules say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped and broke into
uncontrollable laughter again.</p>
<p>Peggy ran over to read the rule that was causing
Florence so much amusement. Then she too
began to laugh, stopping only long enough to
exclaim, &ldquo;Oh&mdash;this is killing!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the joke? What on earth does that
say?&rdquo; Jo Ann demanded.</p>
<p>Peggy checked her laughter long enough to
answer, &ldquo;It says when a guest&mdash;wishes to iron&mdash;to
call the office, and ironing board&mdash;and
iron&rsquo;ll be sent up immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann&rsquo;s jaw dropped, as did Miss Prudence&rsquo;s.
Their expressions were so ridiculous
that Florence and Peggy continued laughing till
the tears rolled down their cheeks.</p>
<p>After an amazed, &ldquo;And to think I could&rsquo;ve
had a real iron and board for the asking!&rdquo; Jo
Ann began laughing equally merrily.</p>
<p>They were all still smiling broadly several
minutes later when they went down to the lobby
to meet Lucile and her mother, who were waiting
for them there.</p>
<p>The dinner party turned out to be a great success,
and the girls did not return to the hotel till
almost eleven o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my turn to sleep with Miss Prudence,&rdquo;
Peggy remarked on entering the other girls&rsquo;
room, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m scared to go in there and wake
her up this late. She&rsquo;d think it an unearthly
hour.&rdquo; She stopped talking and smiled over at
the girls. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to be polite and ask
me to sleep with you? You&rsquo;d better, because I&rsquo;m
going to, invitation or no invitation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a mock groan Jo Ann looked at the
double bed and then at Peggy. &ldquo;Say, Florence,&rdquo;
she remarked finally, &ldquo;I feel sorry for ourselves,
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put her in the middle where she can take the
consequences,&rdquo; suggested Florence, her eyes
twinkling.</p>
<p>Jo Ann grimaced. &ldquo;The consequences&rsquo;ll
probably be that you and I&rsquo;ll be out on the floor
before the night&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After much subdued giggling and chatter the
three girls finally climbed into bed and drifted
off to sleep.</p>
<p>About five o&rsquo;clock the next morning they were
aroused by someone knocking at the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>Peggy waked with a start. &ldquo;Someone knocking!
Maybe the hotel&rsquo;s afire and they&rsquo;re trying
to rouse us!&rdquo; darted through her mind.</p>
<p>She flung off the covers, tumbled over the
sleeping Jo Ann, and rushed to the door to find
an anxious-faced Miss Prudence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness you&rsquo;re here, Peggy,&rdquo; Miss
Prudence exclaimed. &ldquo;I just woke up and found
you weren&rsquo;t in my room, and I was so alarmed!
Are the other girls here?&rdquo; She snapped on the
light and stood blinking at the frightened Florence
and Jo Ann, who by this time were sitting
up in bed, trying to figure out what had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that you&rsquo;re all awake you might as well
dress, so we can get an early start,&rdquo; Miss Prudence
announced crisply.</p>
<p>Jo Ann groaned audibly and sank back in the
bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it only about two or three o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;
Florence asked hesitatingly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy, no! It&rsquo;s after five. It takes you girls
so long to dress that it&rsquo;ll be six or half past before
you&rsquo;ll be ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I&rsquo;m so&mdash;so sleepy!&rdquo; Peggy yawned.
&ldquo;Five o&rsquo;clock&rsquo;s an awful hour to get up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Prudence eyed her severely. &ldquo;You stayed
up too late last night, probably. Just dash some
cold water in your face&mdash;that&rsquo;ll wake you.&rdquo; She
added with a whimsical note in her voice, &ldquo;Perhaps
I&rsquo;d better do it for you&mdash;and sprinkle some
on Florence and Jo Ann, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, have a heart, Miss Prudence!&rdquo; Jo Ann
begged, burrowing her head under the covers.</p>
<p>Seeing that Miss Prudence was in earnest
about the early start and was going to stay there
to see that they did get up and dress, Florence
and Jo Ann reluctantly slipped out of bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we reach the mine, I&rsquo;m going to sleep
and sleep to make up for all this lost time,&rdquo; Jo
Ann murmured to the girls between yawns as she
was dressing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ll even sleep through the siesta
hour&mdash;you couldn&rsquo;t learn that trick last summer,
it seemed,&rdquo; Peggy replied. &ldquo;I take to sleeping
the way Miss Prudence does to getting up with
the chickens. Maybe the tropical heat&rsquo;ll make
her more sleepy-headed down there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence smiled. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s hoping it will.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br /><span class="small">THE HIDDEN CAR</span></h2>
<p>Once they were in the car and on their way,
winding along the Rio Grande and breathing
in the fresh, invigorating morning air, they felt
better about having had to start so early.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make the city early this afternoon, at
this rate,&rdquo; Peggy remarked. &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll give us
time to do a little sightseeing. I wish we didn&rsquo;t
have to go clear to Laredo before we cross the
river. I&rsquo;m eager to get on Mexican soil right
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way with me,&rdquo; Jo Ann added. &ldquo;I
wish there were a short cut somewhere. It seems
as if there ought to be.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>When, two hours later, they stopped at a filling
station in a little town to get some gas, and
Jo Ann made this same remark to the service
man, he looked puzzled and merely nodded his
head. Florence, realizing that he understood
little English, began questioning him in Spanish.</p>
<p>All smiles on hearing his native language, he
answered at once, &ldquo;<i>S&iacute;</i>, there is a bridge you can
cross here. They are putting in a new highway
across the desert, which joins the main highway
from Laredo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien.</i> I think we shall go that way,&rdquo; Florence
replied. &ldquo;It will save us much time, will it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>S&iacute;</i>&mdash;a little. It is about a hundred kilometers
less, that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence smiled. &ldquo;That is very good.&rdquo; Now
that she was so close to the country where her
parents lived she was growing more and more
eager to get home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That desert road doesn&rsquo;t sound good to me,&rdquo;
Miss Prudence put in, shaking her gray head
vigorously. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably impassable. Ask him
if it&rsquo;s any worse than this one. I certainly don&rsquo;t
want to get stranded in the desert.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>Florence obediently relayed her question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there isn&rsquo;t any rain&rdquo;&mdash;the man grinned
and shrugged his shoulders&mdash;&ldquo;you can drive
through all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence translated to Miss Prudence what
he had said and added, &ldquo;The rainy season doesn&rsquo;t
begin till September. We&rsquo;re not likely to have
rain. Look at the sky!&rdquo; She gestured to the cloudless
expanse of blue above them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so dry and hot now it&rsquo;s hard to believe it
ever rains in this forsaken country.&rdquo; Miss Prudence
hesitated a moment, then went on, &ldquo;If
we&rsquo;ll save that much distance through this awful
country, maybe we&rsquo;d better try it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grand!&rdquo; ejaculated all three girls together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, how good!&rdquo; sang out Carlitos in Spanish.</p>
<p>While Miss Prudence was still pointing out
the country&rsquo;s bad points, Jo Ann followed the
man&rsquo;s directions and turned into the side road
leading across the toll bridge. With little difficulty
she steered the car down the narrow road,
not stopping till they reached the bridge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>As soon as they had passed over the middle of
the bridge, the girls and Carlitos, to Miss Prudence&rsquo;s
evident disapproval, exclaimed joyously,
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in Mexico now! <i>Viva</i> Mexico! <i>Viva</i>
Mexico!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As both Florence and Carlitos spoke Spanish
fluently, it did not take them long to answer the
questions asked by the customs officials on the
Mexican side, and so they were soon permitted to
drive on. They had not left the river far behind
before the vegetation began to change again to
the typical desert varieties, mesquite, chaparral,
cacti&mdash;especially the prickly pear and many
other thorn-bearing kinds.</p>
<p>Miss Prudence expressed her opinion by saying
in a disgusted tone, &ldquo;Desolation itself. I
never saw so much land going to waste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But just think how fertile and productive the
land is after it&rsquo;s irrigated,&rdquo; observed Florence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>Miss Prudence passed over Florence&rsquo;s comment
without a word and went on to scold about
the condition of the road. &ldquo;And that man called
this a good road. I&rsquo;d call it a series of gullies.
It&rsquo;s practically impassable. If it should
rain&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; comforted Florence.</p>
<p>On account of the many washed-out places in
the road, Jo Ann found that she had to drive in
low gear frequently. As a result the engine soon
became overheated and steam began to pour out
in jets from the radiator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, gee!&rdquo; she ejaculated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to stop
now and get some water and put it in the radiator.&rdquo;
She drew her brows together into a frown.
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;ll I get the water? We haven&rsquo;t a drop
with us. Of all the tenderfeet, I&rsquo;m the biggest
and greenest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to drive all the way back to the
river&mdash;or maybe we can find a water hole down
toward the river. We might walk down that
gully a piece and see.&rdquo; Florence pointed to the
deep cut leading toward the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo; Jo Ann drew the car up to one
side of the road and stopped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Miss Prudence called
out anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing except our radiator&rsquo;s thirsty. I&rsquo;m
going down here and see if I can find some water
for it.&rdquo; She reached down and picked up a tin
bucket off the floor. &ldquo;Who wants to go with
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; Florence replied.</p>
<p>After eying the thick thorny vegetation on all
sides, Peggy shook her head. &ldquo;Not I. I&rsquo;d feel as
if I were being electrocuted, walking through
all those thorns and stickers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Jo Ann and Florence were picking their
way gingerly along the rocky gully, Jo Ann exclaimed,
&ldquo;Why, look! Here&rsquo;re some automobile
tracks, and here&rsquo;s one that looks as if it&rsquo;d been
made just recently. I can&rsquo;t imagine anyone&rsquo;s being
able to get much farther down here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>When they had gone several yards farther, Jo
Ann noticed that the car tracks led up the sloping
left side of the gully. All at once she spied a
car hidden behind some bushes up on the edge
of the gully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, there&rsquo;s the car!&rdquo; she exclaimed, low-voiced,
pointing to it. &ldquo;Up there behind that
mesquite. Looks as if someone&rsquo;s tried to hide it
there. Something queer about that&mdash;suspicious.
I&rsquo;d like to go up and peek inside it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I for one am not going up to investigate.&rdquo;
Florence caught Jo Ann by the hand and
pulled her along as fast as she could through the
maze of thorny plants. &ldquo;You have entirely too
much curiosity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough to make anyone wonder, to find
a car hidden in such a desolate spot. Maybe&rdquo;&mdash;she
whispered her next word&mdash;&ldquo;smugglers&rsquo;ve
hidden it there. I&rsquo;m going up and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please don&rsquo;t&mdash;please&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Florence
tugged at Jo Ann&rsquo;s arm, but in vain.</p>
<p>Jo Ann turned back and started up the slope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;re bound to go, I might as well
go, too. I&rsquo;m not going to stay here alone.&rdquo; After
this whispered reply Florence began following
her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>Without speaking another word the two girls
climbed on up the slope. Cautiously they peeked
through the mesquite and chaparral to see if
they could notice anyone in or around the
car.</p>
<p>As soon as they were satisfied that there was
no one in sight, Jo Ann made her way up to the
old Ford and peered inside, Florence close behind.</p>
<p>Both girls opened their eyes wide on seeing
the quantities of pottery and baskets piled in the
back of the car.</p>
<p>Just as Jo Ann was about to whisper to Florence
that she believed the car belonged to smugglers,
she suddenly noticed that there was steam
jetting out from the radiator. She pointed meaningly
to the steam.</p>
<p>Florence caught the point immediately. Since
the engine was still hot the car must have been
hidden there only a few minutes before. Without
saying a word she indicated to Jo Ann that they
must hurry away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>Jo Ann lingered for one long keen-eyed look
at the battered old car and especially at the
license tag. She was determined to be able to
identify the car if she should see it again. She
felt that there was something mysterious about
its being hidden there. A moment later she followed
Florence back down the slope. Silently
they continued on down the gully.</p>
<p>On noticing a path leading upward a few
yards ahead on the left, Jo Ann opened her lips
to remark about it. Before she could utter a
word, a man&rsquo;s angry voice floated down, speaking
rapidly in Spanish. What was it he was saying?
Something about&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Florence caught hold of her hand in a convulsive
clutch, and she turned to see Florence&rsquo;s eyes
dilated in terror.</p>
<p>Simultaneously a second voice sounded, with
an even more angry ring in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry! Let&rsquo;s run!&rdquo; Florence breathed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>To Florence&rsquo;s consternation, Jo Ann darted
straight up the path. Just before reaching the
top she halted and peered cautiously in the direction
of the men&rsquo;s voices, then scurried silently
back.</p>
<p>Together the two ran up the gully, not even
halting when thorns tore Florence&rsquo;s skirt and
scratched a red gash in one of Jo Ann&rsquo;s legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those men must&rsquo;ve said something terrible
to scare Florence this way,&rdquo; Jo Ann thought as
she ran. &ldquo;All I could make out were the words
&lsquo;money&rsquo; and &lsquo;thief.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the two rushed, with only a hurried glance
backward now and then.</p>
<p>When at last, panting and puffing, they
reached the road, Jo Ann gasped, &ldquo;What&rsquo;d&mdash;they
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first one said&mdash;&lsquo;he&rsquo;s a thief&mdash;cheating us&mdash;I&rsquo;m
going to kill him.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wh-ew!&rdquo; Jo Ann ejaculated while Florence
was catching her breath. &ldquo;The other&mdash;what&rsquo;d
he say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll help&mdash;you kill him.&rsquo; Then he
said&mdash;something about some packages weighing
more than his enemy had paid them for.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did he say what was in the packages?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe those men are smugglers, don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence nodded. &ldquo;I feel sure they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose they belong to that gang of
smugglers the mystery man was after?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;ll know those men if I ever see
them again&mdash;their car, too.&rdquo; Jo Ann threw another
hasty glance over her shoulder. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better
get away from this place soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the engine&rsquo;s so hot&mdash;and we haven&rsquo;t any
water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s hoping the engine&rsquo;s cooled off by
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they reached the car, Jo Ann glanced
anxiously to see if the steam were still rising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness!&rdquo; she murmured as she saw
there was no sign of misty vapor rising from the
radiator. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get away from this spot in a
hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>When they reached the car, Peggy called out,
&ldquo;We&rsquo;d decided you&rsquo;d tumbled into a water hole
or the Rio Grande and drowned. What kept you
so long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Er&mdash;we&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Florence.</p>
<p>Jo Ann broke in hurriedly with, &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t
find any water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we do?&rdquo; Miss Prudence spoke up
quickly. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t go on without water, can
we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the engine&rsquo;s cooled enough by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it would be the height of folly to start
out on a desert road without water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By that time Jo Ann had started the car, but
not before both she and Florence had looked
anxiously toward the gully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something happened down in that gully that
scared them,&rdquo; Peggy told herself knowingly on
noticing their anxious side glances and the excited
expression in their eyes. &ldquo;As soon as I get
them off to themselves, I&rsquo;m going to find out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI
<br /><span class="small">A FAMILIAR FACE</span></h2>
<p>It was with the keenest relief that Jo Ann managed
to start the car and drive away before the
men appeared. She was not alone in feeling relieved.</p>
<p>Florence&rsquo;s taut body relaxed, and she remarked,
in a low tone, &ldquo;That was a narrow
escape. If those men&rsquo;d seen us, no telling&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
She left her sentence unfinished.</p>
<p>Jo Ann nodded understandingly. Those men
would have been more angry than ever if they
had known that she and Florence had been
listening to them and peeking into their car. It
was too bad she and Florence couldn&rsquo;t have got
some water, but she would far rather run the risk
of finding water elsewhere than for those men to
have discovered them there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>Florence seemed to have read her thoughts as
she remarked the next moment, &ldquo;Surely we&rsquo;ll be
able to find some water soon. We&rsquo;ve just got to
get some before we go much farther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The engine soon began to boil again, and Jo
Ann was almost in despair. &ldquo;Now what&rsquo;ll we
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next instant Florence cried excitedly,
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a water carrier! We can get water from
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that donkey cart jogging ahead
there with the barrel on it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. The Mexican&rsquo;s carrying water to some
ranch house or village, and maybe we can get
him to sell us some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a flurry of dust Jo Ann stopped the car beside
the cart, and Florence called out in Spanish
to the old wrinkled water carrier, &ldquo;<i>Buenos
tardes, se&ntilde;or</i>. Will you sell us a little water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the sound of Florence&rsquo;s voice the lazy burro
promptly stopped, and the man stood peering at
them from under his big sombrero.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; Florence went on, &ldquo;we need water for
our car. Will you sell us some?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Muy bien.</i>&rdquo; He nodded his head and reached
for the bucket Jo Ann was holding out to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank my stars someone knows where to get
water in this awful desert!&rdquo; Miss Prudence exclaimed,
feeling relieved at sight of the water.
&ldquo;Do you suppose that is the only way the people
have of getting water out here, Florence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d certainly hate to live here! Imagine
having to drink that water! And washing dishes
and clothes in a thimbleful of water wouldn&rsquo;t
suit me at all, either. I have the whole Atlantic
Ocean right at the edge of my home in Massachusetts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence smiled at the contrast of life in the
desert and on the seacoast.</p>
<p>After they had filled the radiator and their
thermos jug with the precious fluid, they drove
off, the girls and Carlitos all calling a smiling
&ldquo;<i>adios</i>&rdquo; to the water carrier.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>A little later, at the old stone house on the edge
of the village, they were halted and their passports
examined. As they were waiting for one of
the men to look over the papers Carlitos and
Florence talked in Spanish to the other man. Jo
Ann half smiled to herself as she noticed Miss
Prudence&rsquo;s evident disapproval at seeing Carlitos&rsquo;s
delight on finding someone with whom to
speak Spanish.</p>
<p>Catching Jo Ann&rsquo;s expression, Miss Prudence
remarked crisply, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get used to having a
foreigner for a nephew. I have my doubts if he&rsquo;ll
ever get to be a genuine American.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew Spanish as well as he does. I
love the language&mdash;it&rsquo;s beautiful,&rdquo; Jo Ann replied.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be glad, if I were you, that he knows
it; maybe he&rsquo;ll soon be speaking English as
easily as Spanish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>As Jo Ann drove the car slowly through the
narrow streets of the quaint old village, the girls
gazed interestedly at the adobe and stone houses
and the picturesque church with its bell tower.
From behind half-closed doors they caught
glimpses of dark, eager faces peering at them.
A moment later the road sloped down an abrupt
hill, and there was nothing to be seen but the
bleak expanse of desert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a weird beauty about the desert,&rdquo;
Peggy commented thoughtfully to Florence as
she gazed at the vast stretch of silvery grays and
tawny browns which were rolled out before them
and silhouetted against the deep blue of the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve decided there&rsquo;s no spot on earth where
there isn&rsquo;t beauty of some description. I agree
with you that the desert has its share of loveliness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it has its share of washes and gullies
too,&rdquo; spoke up Miss Prudence as the car suddenly
dipped into a deep cut which jolted them
vigorously from side to side.</p>
<p>About an hour later, Carlitos suddenly exclaimed,
&ldquo;Oh, look&mdash;the mountains! See, over
there!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>The other four stared in the southwesterly direction
in which he was pointing, and soon all
were able to distinguish the low irregular purple
line of mountains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sight of those mountains thrills me,&rdquo; declared
Florence with a joyous exultation that the
other girls and Carlitos shared. &ldquo;Just think!
Back of that line there&rsquo;s another higher range,
then another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From then on they watched the mountains become
more and more distinct, the deep purple
changing into a soft, mauve-tinted gray, while
the distant ranges gradually came into view,
their lofty majestic peaks cloud-wreathed.</p>
<p>When at last they reached the main paved
highway, Miss Prudence&rsquo;s expression brightened.
&ldquo;Thank my stars we&rsquo;re on a good road at
last!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh boy! What a road!&rdquo; cried Jo Ann as she
turned into the smooth-paved highway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>The miles seemed to fly by, and almost before
she realized it they had reached the first mountain
range and begun to climb the walled-in
highway which wound back and forth up the
mountain side.</p>
<p>So intent was Jo Ann upon keeping the car
close to the cliffs, she could catch only fleeting
glimpses of the valley below and of the road beyond
as it threaded its way higher and higher.
The other four, however, had plenty of time to
drink in the majestic beauty of the scenery.</p>
<p>Several times Miss Prudence became alarmed
over Jo Ann&rsquo;s ability to manage Jitters and
started to caution her, but each time Peggy broke
in with such warm praises of Jo Ann&rsquo;s driving
that she subsided. &ldquo;Jo never lets her nerves run
away with her,&rdquo; Peggy declared. &ldquo;She always
keeps her head in emergencies, like the good
scout that she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She may be able to keep her nerves from running
away, but can she keep this old Ford from
running amuck?&rdquo; Miss Prudence came back
sharply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. Jitters is hitting on all four&mdash;humming
along like a&mdash;well, maybe not like a Cadillac,
exactly, but at least like a much better car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of Peggy&rsquo;s encouragement Miss Prudence
did not cease to be nervous till they
reached a more level stretch.</p>
<p>When at last they came in sight of the city,
the girls&rsquo; and Carlitos&rsquo;s excitement reached the
boiling point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I can speak de Spanish in de city,&rdquo; exulted
Carlitos, oblivious of Miss Prudence&rsquo;s
frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t you hope the band plays tonight
so we can promenade around the Plaza?&rdquo; exclaimed
Peggy. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the most fun! The lovely
music&mdash;those beautiful dark-eyed se&ntilde;oritas&mdash;and,
oh, those handsome men! Light of my eyes!
Pride of my heart!&rdquo; Peggy placed her hand over
her heart in a ridiculously exaggerated gesture
that sent Florence into peals of laughter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>Suddenly remembering that Peggy&rsquo;s exaggerated
acting might have been misunderstood
by Miss Prudence, Florence hastily checked her
mirth and remarked, &ldquo;Peggy doesn&rsquo;t mean anything
by her raving. She&rsquo;s perfectly harmless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On nearing the outskirts of the city Miss Prudence
suggested to Florence that, as she was
familiar with the hotels, she choose the best one
and drive directly to it. &ldquo;When I say choose the
best one, I mean the most modern one,&rdquo; she explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a beautiful new one just built recently
that I know you&rsquo;ll like,&rdquo; Florence replied,
then added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d better drive the rest of the way,
as I&rsquo;m familiar with the city and the narrow one-way
streets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann stopped the car saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to
turn the wheel over to you. I&rsquo;d get all mixed up
on the one-way streets and go in the wrong direction
every time, since all the signs are in
Spanish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With eyes eager and shining, the four young
people viewed the streets, the shops and houses,
and the crowds in the downtown section.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>When Florence stopped the car in front of the
city&rsquo;s most modern hotel, Miss Prudence went
with Florence and Peggy to see about rooms
while Jo Ann stayed in the car with Carlitos.</p>
<p>A smiling little black-eyed Mexican newsboy
ran up to the car to try to sell them a paper, and
Carlitos promptly bought one; not that he
wanted to read it, but because he wanted to talk
to a real Mexican boy once more. He was still
chatting with him in a lively flow of Spanish
when Miss Prudence came back. At first she
frowned in disapproval, then began to smile. &ldquo;I
might as well be resigned to having a little Mexican
for a nephew,&rdquo; she remarked to Jo Ann.
&ldquo;Carlitos loves Mexican people and their language.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, too,&rdquo; Jo Ann replied. &ldquo;Spanish is such a
beautiful language, and the people here&mdash;why,
there aren&rsquo;t any friendlier, more smiling people
anywhere in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>As soon as they had gone up to their cheerful,
airy hotel rooms, bathed and dressed, it was time
for supper. At Florence&rsquo;s suggestion they went
to an old restaurant with a more distinctive
Mexican atmosphere and cookery than the hotel
had. The girls, as well as Carlitos, thoroughly
enjoyed ordering from a menu card written in
both Spanish and English.</p>
<p>Miss Prudence smiled whimsically as she
glanced at the card and remarked to Florence
and Carlitos, &ldquo;You two may order your food in
Spanish, but not I.&rdquo; Her smile suddenly disappeared
on noticing the high prices: &ldquo;Scrambled
eggs&mdash;forty cents,&rdquo; she read. &ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s terrible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s in Mexican money,&rdquo; laughed Florence.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s only about thirteen cents in American.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Prudence nodded. &ldquo;O-oh! I see. I&rsquo;d forgotten
about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a delicious meal that the alert, polite
waiter brought them, and even Miss Prudence,
who at first was dubious about Mexican cookery&rsquo;s
comparing favorably with New England&rsquo;s,
praised it enthusiastically.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>Florence and Carlitos, though, enjoyed it most
of all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That <i>chocolat&eacute;</i> is the best I&rsquo;ve had since I left
Mexico last fall,&rdquo; Florence declared, while Carlitos
was all smiles over the <i>frijoles</i> and <i>chile
con carne</i>.</p>
<p>When they left the restaurant, it was twilight,
and they could hear the band in the little park,
or plaza, as it was called, playing an old Mexican
air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s go to the Plaza now and promenade!&rdquo;
exclaimed Peggy eagerly. &ldquo;I adore walking
around and around the square with the
crowds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, let&rsquo;s,&rdquo; agreed Florence. &ldquo;You want to
go, too, don&rsquo;t you, Jo Ann?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. I may let you girls do the strolling
around while I sit on one of the spectators&rsquo;
benches and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; scoffed Peggy. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re no Methuselah.
You&rsquo;ll have to promenade too. When
you&rsquo;re in Mexico, do as the Mexicans do, my
dear.&rdquo; Realizing that Miss Prudence had not
given her consent to their plan, she began explaining
how the Mexican girls walked slowly
round and round the square, while the boys
walked equally as slowly on the inside in the opposite
direction, exchanging smiles and a few
words now and then but not stopping. &ldquo;And
chaperons! I never saw so many. You won&rsquo;t have
seen Mexico unless you see this scene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Prudence smiled. &ldquo;That being the case,
I&rsquo;ll have to go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as they had reached the Plaza, Miss
Prudence and Carlitos found seats, and the three
girls joined the laughing, dark-eyed se&ntilde;oritas,
mingling with them and feeling a warm kinship&mdash;a
oneness with them.</p>
<p>Jo Ann, having been the one on the outside,
found her attention centered on the spectators
sitting or standing near the curb rather than on
the boys on the inside of the Plaza.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>Just as she reached one of the corners, she
caught a sudden glimpse of a familiar face in
the crowd in the background. Her heart leaped.
There was the mystery man! The very man to
whom she had listened in the hotel in Houston.
Thank goodness, he hadn&rsquo;t lost his life!</p>
<p>As she slowed her steps to look over her shoulder
at him to assure herself that she was not mistaken,
Florence pulled her along saying, &ldquo;No
fair stopping&mdash;you&rsquo;re blocking the line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I just saw the mystery man on that
corner, and I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jo! I declare you must have that man on
your mind. You&rsquo;re probably imagining that it&rsquo;s
he. Someone resembling him, perhaps it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no! It was he. When we get back
around to that corner I&rsquo;ll point him out to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;re going to point out, Jo?&rdquo;
broke in Peggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mystery man! I&rsquo;ve just seen him. I wish
you didn&rsquo;t have to keep going in the same direction.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>Jo Ann could scarcely wait to get back to that
corner. It seemed miles around the square to her
this time. When at last she reached the corner
again, she gazed eagerly about for the stalwart,
keen-eyed stranger, but he was not to be seen
anywhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, shoot! He&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; she exclaimed, exasperated.
&ldquo;And I wanted to tell him about those
smugglers we saw back there in the desert.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII
<br /><span class="small">&ldquo;WE MUST GET AN EARLY START&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>Peggy stretched her eyes wide. &ldquo;Smugglers!
You actually saw some smugglers in the desert?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh! Not so loud,&rdquo; Jo Ann warned, low-voiced.
&ldquo;We think they were smugglers, but of
course we can&rsquo;t be absolutely certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that was what you and Florence were so
excited about when you came back to the car out
there in the desert. Hurry up and tell me all
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t&mdash;not here, with all these people
around. Wait till we get to the hotel; then we&rsquo;ll
tell you everything, won&rsquo;t we, Florence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence nodded assent.</p>
<p>After a second time around the Plaza without
seeing the mystery man, Jo Ann was more
disappointed than ever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>When they reached the place where Miss Prudence
and Carlitos were sitting, Miss Prudence
gestured to them to step from the line and come
to her side. &ldquo;Girls,&rdquo; she began as soon as they
walked over, &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;d better leave now and
go on back to the hotel. You know the trip tomorrow
up the mountains to the mine is bound
to be a very hard one. We must get an early start
in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On hearing these familiar words, &ldquo;get an early
start,&rdquo; the girls exchanged swift glances but succeeded
in keeping sober expressions on their
faces.</p>
<p>Peggy protested lightly, &ldquo;This music is so
lovely, I hate to leave it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be able to hear it from your room at
the hotel&mdash;it&rsquo;s so close by,&rdquo; Miss Prudence replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peggy likes to promenade as well as to hear
the music,&rdquo; Florence put in, teasing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll have other opportunities to promenade,
probably.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; put in Florence. &ldquo;The mine is not so
far away but what we can come back here at
least a few times this summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Prudence rose from the bench and
started toward the hotel, the girls following, but
not without several backward glances at the
fascinating Plaza and the gay young crowd.</p>
<p>Peggy would not have followed as meekly if
it had not been that she was eager to hear Florence&rsquo;s
and Jo Ann&rsquo;s tale about the smugglers.
Jo Ann, too, would not have been so willing to
go if it had not been that the mystery man had
disappeared and she now felt that she would not
get a chance to tell him about the smugglers.</p>
<p>When they reached the hotel, Florence, who
was to be Miss Prudence&rsquo;s roommate, went on
with Jo Ann and Peggy to their room, explaining
to Miss Prudence that she would come to
bed shortly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>As soon as Peggy had closed the door of their
room, she ordered, &ldquo;Tell that tale about the
smugglers from beginning to end. I knew something
exciting had happened to you back there
in the desert, and I don&rsquo;t know why I forgot to
ask about it sooner unless it was because I was
so interested in getting to the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann, with Florence&rsquo;s frequent promptings,
quickly recounted the details about the hidden
car, its contents, and the men&rsquo;s angry conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wh-ew, I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t go with you after
the water,&rdquo; Peggy exclaimed when they had finished.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have been sure to have shrieked or
squealed, and they&rsquo;d have discovered me. One
thing I don&rsquo;t understand, though, is what makes
you so certain they were smugglers. The fact
that they had baskets and pottery in their car
doesn&rsquo;t prove that they were trying to take them
across the border without paying duty, does it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Jo Ann replied. &ldquo;Think what a good
blind the pottery and baskets would be! It would
look as if the men were regular merchants buying
Mexican wares for the trade in the States,
wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>Peggy nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then think how easy it&rsquo;d be to conceal dope
or gold in the jars and vases and baskets. It&rsquo;s dope
or gold&mdash;or both&mdash;they&rsquo;re probably smuggling.
The chances are the packages the men complained
about not being weighed correctly held
one or both of those articles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so. Those are the things the coast
guard said were smuggled most frequently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to be satisfied till I see my
mystery man again,&rdquo; Jo Ann went on earnestly.
&ldquo;I could tell him the exact spot where we&rsquo;d seen
that hidden car, and that might be the very bit of
information he needs to be able to catch the
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be at all surprised if those men
belong to the gang that man&rsquo;s trying to break up.
I wish, Jo, you could see that mystery man and
tell him all this, but in this big city&rdquo;&mdash;Florence
shook her head dubiously&mdash;&ldquo;your chances of
seeing him again are small.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>Jo Ann&rsquo;s chin took on a determined little tilt.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming back here as soon as I can and look
for him. I believe this main plaza is a good place
to look for him, too. It&rsquo;s a sort of central meeting
place for everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence nodded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. Everybody
naturally gravitates toward the Plaza. It&rsquo;s the
very heart of the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long after Florence had left to go to Miss
Prudence&rsquo;s room and Peggy was sound asleep,
Jo Ann lay wide awake pondering over plans for
getting back to the city and for finding the mystery
man. She had to leave early tomorrow with
the others, as all arrangements had been made
for Florence&rsquo;s father and Carlitos&rsquo;s uncle, Mr.
Eldridge, to meet them at a small village on the
way to the mine.</p>
<p>It was well that they did get an early start the
next morning, as the nearer they approached the
high mountain range beyond the city, the steeper
and more dangerous the road became.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll have to leave our car at the village
and go the rest of the way to La Esperanza
by oxcart or horses,&rdquo; said Peggy. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the
way Mr. Eldridge said they had to do last summer.&rdquo;
She smiled over at Miss Prudence.
&ldquo;Which will you choose, the oxcart or a horse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A horse every time,&rdquo; came back the quick reply.
&ldquo;I love to ride horseback.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grand!&rdquo; approved Jo Ann.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll feel safer&mdash;more comfortable, too&mdash;on a
good horse than in this car.&rdquo; Miss Prudence
added whimsically, &ldquo;I beg your pardon for
knocking Jitters that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann smiled broadly. Miss Prudence was a
good scout after all. She could ride horseback
and condescended now and then to a bit of slang,
such as the word &ldquo;knocking&rdquo; just then.</p>
<p>When they neared San Geronimo where they
were to meet Dr. Blackwell and Mr. Eldridge,
the faces of all five began to glow with anticipation.
Florence could hardly wait to see her
father, and Carlitos his uncle Mr. Eldridge, who
was Miss Prudence&rsquo;s only brother.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>As soon as she caught sight of the flat-roofed
adobe houses of the village Florence began exulting,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll soon see Dad now! He&rsquo;ll be waiting
at old Pedro&rsquo;s store.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll hate to give you up,&rdquo; put in Peggy.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll miss you so much!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be long till I&rsquo;ll be coming over to
see you, and then you can come over and visit
with me and see our city again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we&rsquo;ll end up in spending the summer together
after all,&rdquo; laughed Jo Ann.</p>
<p>Florence nodded so emphatically that Peggy&rsquo;s
face brightened again.</p>
<p>In a few more minutes Florence stopped the
car in front of the little store, then leaped out
and into the arms of a tall, distinguished, gray-haired
man, crying, &ldquo;Daddy! Oh, Daddy! I&rsquo;m
so glad to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then a tall thin man and a small black-eyed
Mexican boy rode up on horses and leaped
off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>At sight of them Carlitos shouted joyfully,
&ldquo;My uncle and Pepito! My Pepito!&rdquo; He sprang
out of the car, ran over and greeted his uncle
hastily, then flew over to the grinning little
Mexican and threw his arms affectionately about
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is that child?&rdquo; Miss Prudence demanded
of Jo Ann after they had all exchanged
greetings with Mr. Eldridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Pepito, his foster brother&mdash;the son of
the nurse who took care of Carlitos so many
years. They love each other like real brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We-ell, I suppose they should feel that way,&rdquo;
Miss Prudence said slowly. &ldquo;After all, all the
peoples of the earth are &lsquo;of one blood&rsquo;&mdash;so the
Good Book says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We believe that in theory but don&rsquo;t always
practice it, as Carlitos and Pepito do,&rdquo; put in
Mr. Eldridge, secretly amused at his sister&rsquo;s inward
struggle to accept this relationship between
her nephew and the little Mexican.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;re the horses we&rsquo;re to ride?&rdquo; Peggy
asked curiously after looking about on all sides.
&ldquo;Or are we going to ride in that oxcart over
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that won&rsquo;t be necessary. I left the horses
on up the road about twelve miles,&rdquo; Mr. Eldridge
answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had the road repaired so
you can drive the car to the foot of the mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s grand!&rdquo; exclaimed both girls together.
&ldquo;Not that we don&rsquo;t like to ride horseback,&rdquo;
added Jo Ann, &ldquo;but we can travel so much
faster in Jitters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After many words of farewell Florence and
her father drove off down the highway which
led to the town farther into the interior where
they lived.</p>
<p>In a few more minutes, Jo Ann was steering
Jitters out of the village and into the road which
led to the mine. She had only two other passengers
now, as Carlitos insisted on riding on the
horse with Pepito.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>Just as she was about to pass a little shack on
the outskirts of the village, she caught sight of
an empty old Ford parked under a mesquite tree
just off the road. She stared at it incredulously,
then cried out a sharp, &ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s that same
car we&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She checked her words suddenly,
swerving the car dangerously near an irrigation
ditch at the side of the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy!&rdquo; gasped Miss Prudence from the
back seat. &ldquo;What are you trying to do&mdash;turn us
over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann&rsquo;s face flamed with excitement and embarrassment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&rsquo;m,&rdquo; she said meekly as she drove on
slowly. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;really&mdash;I don&rsquo;t&mdash;see why I did
such a silly trick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under cover of the car&rsquo;s noise, a little later,
Peggy asked curiously, &ldquo;What on earth made
you so excited over seeing that old car?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann&rsquo;s voice was barely audible as she replied,
&ldquo;Because it was the car Florence and I
saw hidden up in that gully in the desert. Smugglers.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;O-oh! Are you absolutely sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann nodded. &ldquo;It had the same license number,
and the radiator was bumped in exactly the
same places.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII
<br /><span class="small">AT THE MINE</span></h2>
<p>When they neared the foot of the lofty
mountains and the end of the automobile road,
Jo Ann parked the car in front of a small
thatched adobe house. &ldquo;This is the jumping-off
place,&rdquo; she smiled. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s where we leave Jitters
and get our horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Prudence eyed the house curiously.
&ldquo;This must be where Ed told me we were to
change into our riding clothes. He said for us
to be ready by the time he and the boys got here.
I don&rsquo;t fancy going into a strange house in a
strange&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped abruptly as a fat,
smiling-faced Mexican woman appeared at the
open door and began beaming her welcome and
punctuating her Spanish with gestures for them
to come inside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>Summoning her limited Spanish, Jo Ann replied
with a &ldquo;<i>Gracias</i>,&rdquo; then turned and translated
the woman&rsquo;s welcoming words to Miss
Prudence.</p>
<p>After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation Miss Prudence
followed the girls into the house. Her keen eyes
quickly took in the room, which had a neat,
well-kept appearance in spite of its dirt floor
and primitive furniture.</p>
<p>The woman disappeared into the other room,
evidently the kitchen, as they could hear her rattling
dishes and beating vigorously with some
utensil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope she&rsquo;s making us some <i>chocolat&eacute;</i>,&rdquo; Jo
Ann whispered to Peggy as they slipped into
their khaki riding trousers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so too. I&rsquo;m hungry as a bear. Mountain
air always gives me a ravenous appetite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, too. I could wrap myself around a
substantial meal right now, and it&rsquo;ll probably be
two hours yet till we reach the mine&mdash;and supper.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>As Jo Ann&rsquo;s thoughts turned on the distance
to the mine, she wondered how she would be
able to get back to the city and find the mystery
man. Now that she had seen the car of those suspected
smugglers in the village so close by, she
felt it was more imperative than ever for her to
tell the mystery man about them and their
whereabouts. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve simply got to get in touch
with him some way,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<p>So intent was she upon these thoughts that she
did not heed Peggy&rsquo;s nudging her till she
squealed out, &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you put on your boots, Peg,
without poking me in the side?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I most humbly beg your pardon,&rdquo; Peggy
replied, her twinkling eyes showing that her
apology was anything but abject.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>Catching her gesture, a nod of the head in
Miss Prudence&rsquo;s direction, Jo Ann looked over
at Miss Prudence. The next moment her eyes
opened in astonishment. That long, full, navy
skirt Miss Prudence had on&mdash;how on earth was
she ever going to ride in that thing? That must
be one of those old-fashioned side-saddle riding
skirts she&rsquo;d heard her grandmother talk about.
It&rsquo;d be absolutely dangerous to ride side saddle
in this mountainous country. She&rsquo;d often heard
how easily such a saddle was tipped out of balance
and the rider thrown off. The next moment
she relaxed as the thought occurred to her that
there were no side saddles in this part of the
country. Perhaps she&rsquo;d better tell her that.</p>
<p>Somewhat embarrassed, Jo Ann stammered,
&ldquo;Er&mdash;Miss Prudence&mdash;er&mdash;they don&rsquo;t have any&mdash;side
saddles down here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Prudence looked puzzled as she replied
Yankee-fashion with a question, &ldquo;Well, who
wants one?&rdquo; Seeing the girls&rsquo; eyes fastened on
her skirt, she smiled, &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t one of those old
side-saddle riding skirts. It&rsquo;s a divided skirt.&rdquo;
There was a note of pride in her voice as she
added, &ldquo;I was the first woman in my part of the
country to begin riding astride. I shocked the
older people dreadfully.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think you were a good sport, Miss Prudence,
to start that style,&rdquo; Peggy remarked.</p>
<p>Miss Prudence received this praise with a
pleased smile.</p>
<p>Just then the Mexican woman entered with a
tray of food which she set on a little table near
by. Gesturing and talking rapidly to Jo Ann,
she explained, &ldquo;I think you have much hunger,
and I make you some <i>chocolat&eacute;</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though Jo Ann&rsquo;s reply was made in broken
Spanish, it was straight from her heart. &ldquo;<i>Gracias.</i>
You are most kind. We have hunger after
the long ride. And <i>chocolat&eacute;</i>&mdash;I love it.&rdquo; She
raised the cup to her lips and drank a little of
the rich, frothy liquid. &ldquo;This is very delicious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy and Miss Prudence nodded a smiling
approval to the woman, and her black eyes
glowed with happiness at the praise, both spoken
and unspoken.</p>
<p>A few minutes after they had finished eating,
Mr. Eldridge and the two boys rode up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>On going outside Jo Ann saw that there were
three other horses saddled and waiting for them.
She noticed, too, that Jos&eacute;, Pepito&rsquo;s father, was
standing near by, his arms caressingly about
Carlitos, whom he loved almost as dearly as he
did his own son. Carlitos&rsquo;s face was aglow with
happiness at being reunited with his Mexican
friends.</p>
<p>After she and Peggy had mounted, they
watched with curious eyes to see how Miss Prudence
manipulated that queer skirt. When they
saw her unbutton the front panel and fold it
back and refasten it on another set of buttons,
they saw that it was a divided skirt after all.</p>
<p>Peggy leaned over from her horse to murmur
to Jo Ann, &ldquo;It looks like a pair of floppy-legged
pajamas now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann nodded, then added, grinning, &ldquo;I prefer
to sleep in pajamas and ride in trousers. It&rsquo;s
so much more modest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy suppressed a giggle with difficulty at
the thought of the proper Miss Prudence&rsquo;s ever
wearing anything but the most correct clothes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>Notwithstanding the queer skirt, they found
that Miss Prudence rode unusually well, handling
her horse with the ease of an experienced
horsewoman.</p>
<p>Up the steep mountain trail they began climbing
in single file, Jos&eacute; in the lead. The sheer
precipice at the edge looked so dangerous to Jo
Ann that she tried to keep from looking over.
One good thing, they had an excellent guide in
Jos&eacute;. He had led her and Florence over worse
places than this.</p>
<p>On nearing the mine a strange feeling of
tenseness filled the girls and Carlitos; and yet
that was not surprising, as the mine had been the
scene of the most thrilling adventures they had
ever experienced. It was here that they had been
rescued from the treacherous mine foreman who
had stolen the mine from Carlitos&rsquo;s father.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>On their arrival at the great stone house that
this foreman had so proudly built for his own
use, they found Jos&eacute;&rsquo;s wife, Maria, the nurse
who had reared Carlitos as one of her family.
Though she was only a poor ignorant woman
of the peon class, the girls as well as Carlitos
loved her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maria has a heart of gold,&rdquo; Jo Ann told
Miss Prudence as they watched her enfold Carlitos
in her arms and kiss him on each cheek.
&ldquo;She loves him as she does her own Pepito and
her girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later Maria proudly showed
Carlitos to his room, into which she had put the
best of everything, then took Miss Prudence and
the girls to adjoining rooms, which looked bare
and forbidding with their concrete floors, scant
furniture, and curtainless, iron-barred windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like a soldiers&rsquo; barracks,&rdquo; Miss Prudence
said crisply after a swift glance about.</p>
<p>Jo Ann laughed, then said, &ldquo;You should have
seen this house as it was the first time I saw
it. There was a grand piano in every room
with a game rooster tied to one of the piano
legs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>Miss Prudence gasped. &ldquo;A rooster in every
room! Heavens! You mean to say this whole
house was a chicken coop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly. It was just that Mexican foreman&rsquo;s
idea of the luxurious life. He loved music
and cock fighting, so he wanted the pianos and
roosters handy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; gasped Miss Prudence again.
&ldquo;Why, I must fumigate this whole house, clean
it with Old Dutch Cleanser, Lysol&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Maria cleaned it long ago&mdash;thoroughly,&rdquo;
broke in Jo Ann quickly, seeing that
the anxious-eyed Maria was watching Miss Prudence&rsquo;s
frown of evident disapproval and was
worried. She turned now to Maria and said in
Spanish, &ldquo;The house is very clean. You have
worked hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria&rsquo;s grave eyes brightened. &ldquo;Yes, the little
girls and I work hard.&rdquo; She gestured to the
window and the corners of the room. &ldquo;See, I
clean it good like Carlitos&rsquo;s mam&aacute; show me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>Though Miss Prudence had caught from
these gestures that Maria was showing how thoroughly
she had cleaned the house, she was far
from being convinced that it was fit for human
habitation. Again she broke into a list of the
different kinds of cleansing materials and things
that she would need.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to go to the city to get all those
things,&rdquo; put in Peggy. &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t have them
in the little store in the village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann&rsquo;s eyes suddenly began to shine. Here
was her chance to get back to the city to find the
mystery man. She could stop in the village and
find out what those smugglers were doing there.
Maybe they were buying baskets and pottery
from the villagers. She&rsquo;d soon find out now.</p>
<p>The first moment she and Peggy were alone
she told her of her plans.</p>
<p>Peggy laughed. &ldquo;I knew that&rsquo;s what you were
planning. You can&rsquo;t resist a mystery, can you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re almost as eager as I am to have a
finger in my mystery pie. You know you&rsquo;re crazy
to go to the city with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I am.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX
<br /><span class="small">MISS PRUDENCE&rsquo;S CLEANING SPREE</span></h2>
<p>Before dropping to sleep that night Jo Ann
decided that as soon as she got up in the morning
she would urge Miss Prudence to let her
and Peggy go to the city. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell her what this
house needs worse than another cleaning is some
pretty cretonne for curtains and pillows, and
some of the lovely Mexican pottery and bright-colored
blankets. I could stop at the village and
buy the pottery and blankets. There were some
pieces of pottery outside that shack near where
the smugglers&rsquo; car was parked. That&rsquo;d give
me a grand chance to find out from the family
in the shack about the smugglers. Then I&rsquo;d
have more to tell the mystery man&mdash;if I
can find him. Finding him&mdash;that&rsquo;ll be the
hard part.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>Still visioning ways and plans for this trip to
the city, she finally drifted off to sleep.</p>
<p>She was roused early the next morning by a
cold hand upon her bare shoulder. Horrors!
One of those smugglers had grabbed her&mdash;she&rsquo;d
jerk away from him! She sprang out of bed with
a leap that sent her into the middle of the room,
then stood staring dazedly at an amazed Miss
Prudence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I didn&rsquo;t mean to frighten you, Jo
Ann,&rdquo; she said apologetically. &ldquo;I just meant to
wake you early so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O-oh, it&rsquo;s just you!&rdquo; gasped Jo Ann, feeling
very foolish at seeing it was only Miss Prudence.
&ldquo;I must&rsquo;ve been dreaming. I thought one of
those&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped abruptly. She must not
say a word about having seen those smugglers.
No use to get Miss Prudence stirred up and excited
over them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I scared you,&rdquo; Miss Prudence began
again, &ldquo;but I thought we ought to get an
early start to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re at the end of our journey,&rdquo; broke
in Peggy, who was sitting up in bed now, rubbing
her eyes sleepily. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have any place
to start early to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I began to say was that we ought to
get an early start at giving this house a thorough
cleaning,&rdquo; Miss Prudence went on, undisturbed
by Peggy&rsquo;s interruption.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The house looks clean to me&mdash;very clean,&rdquo;
Jo Ann remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maria may have gone through the motions
of cleaning, but&rdquo;&mdash;Miss Prudence raised her
eyebrows skeptically&mdash;&ldquo;a peon housekeeper&rsquo;s
ideas of cleaning and an American&rsquo;s are two different
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want us to go to the city to get
some&mdash;some fumigating stuff&mdash;formaldehyde,
isn&rsquo;t that what you call it?&rdquo; Jo Ann asked
eagerly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve decided it isn&rsquo;t necessary to have the
place fumigated. I&rsquo;ve decided there&rsquo;s enough
laundry soap here to begin with. Ed says he&rsquo;s
ordered more, and a lot of supplies that should
have come to the village yesterday. He thinks
they&rsquo;ll come today surely. I&rsquo;ll make plenty of
strong suds, and we can begin scrubbing this
morning. When we get through, this place&rsquo;ll
be as bright as a new penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll still be dreadfully bare, though,&rdquo; Jo
Ann remarked tentatively. &ldquo;As you said last
night, it looks as bare as a barracks. What it
needs is gay cretonne draperies and pillows,
bright-colored blankets to throw over the chests
and couches, and some of the lovely Mexican
<i>ollas</i>. As soon as we get the house clean, let&rsquo;s go
to the city to get the draperies. We can probably
find some pottery and blankets at the village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll think about that later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sooner we get this house fixed up, the
longer we&rsquo;ll have to enjoy it,&rdquo; spoke up Peggy,
coming to Jo Ann&rsquo;s aid. She knew how Jo Ann&rsquo;s
heart was set on getting back to the city. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
try to have it all done by the time Florence
comes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls had to content themselves with that
vague promise.</p>
<p>After Miss Prudence had left the room and
the girls were dressing, Jo Ann remarked, &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t given up hope yet of going to the city
soon. I&rsquo;m going to try to persuade Miss Prudence
to let us go to the village this afternoon
for the supplies that Mr. Eldridge is expecting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help persuade her.&rdquo; Peggy changed the
subject abruptly by saying, &ldquo;I hate to have her
hurt Maria&rsquo;s feelings by doing all this cleaning,
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to smooth it over to
Maria, but she&rsquo;ll never be able to understand
such extreme ideas about sanitation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as they had finished eating breakfast,
the girls entered industriously into Miss Prudence&rsquo;s
&ldquo;cleaning spree,&rdquo; as Jo Ann called it.
While Peggy poured the soapy water over the
concrete floors, Jo Ann scrubbed vigorously
enough to satisfy even Miss Prudence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really fun,&rdquo; Jo Ann declared as she
swished the foamy suds about with her broom.</p>
<p>Miss Prudence, a towel over her head and her
long skirts tucked up and pinned in the back,
bustled about superintending the girls, Maria
and her oldest daughters, and the two boys.</p>
<p>Maria was horrified that Miss Prudence
should set Carlitos, the chief owner of the silver
mine and the house, to doing such menial tasks
as carrying water from the stream back of the
house. Miss Prudence, however, believed with
St. Paul that he who would not work should not
eat and soon had everybody in the household
stepping lively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish that soap and other supplies&rsquo;d come
today,&rdquo; she said, frowning as she took out the
last bar of soap. &ldquo;The supplies are very low. I
can&rsquo;t plan a decent meal in this house without
those things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peggy and I&rsquo;ll go to the village for them this
afternoon,&rdquo; Jo Ann offered eagerly. &ldquo;We can
drive the car and make better time than Jos&eacute; can
in the oxcart.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>Miss Prudence hesitated a moment, then replied,
&ldquo;Well, if Jos&eacute; can go with you, I believe
you&rsquo;d better go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine! I&rsquo;m sure Mr. Eldridge&rsquo;ll let Jos&eacute; go.
He sends him there frequently for the mail&mdash;every
other day, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann was right in this surmise. Mr. Eldridge
promptly agreed to let Jos&eacute; accompany
the girls to the village. &ldquo;Jos&eacute; can take two burros
along to carry the supplies,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;and
he won&rsquo;t need the oxcart at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was that shortly after lunch the two girls
and Jos&eacute; started on horseback but changed into
the automobile when they reached the foot of
the mountain.</p>
<p>On reaching the village they drove straight
to Pedro&rsquo;s store to see if the supplies had come.
On finding that they had arrived, Jos&eacute; set to
work to load them into the car. While he was
busy at that task, Jo Ann and Peggy walked
back to the adobe shack where Jo Ann had seen
the smugglers&rsquo; car.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>To Jo Ann&rsquo;s relief, the battered old car was
not in sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a far better chance to find out about
the smugglers without their being on the scene,&rdquo;
she remarked to Peggy.</p>
<p>As soon as they neared the shack, a thin, undernourished
woman with a black <i>rebosa</i> about
her shoulders and a baby in her arms appeared
at the door. Peeping from behind her skirts were
several other small, half-clad, hungry-looking
children. As quickly as she could in her broken
Spanish, Jo Ann explained that she wanted to
buy some of the pottery jars piled up at the side
of the house.</p>
<p>The woman shook her head and replied, &ldquo;I
have much sorrow that I cannot sell them to you.
Two men in an automobile told me they take all
my <i>ollas</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that their automobile I saw here near
your house yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I must find out when they will be back,&rdquo; Jo
Ann thought quickly. &ldquo;Can you not get more
jars for these men by the time they come back,
and sell me some of these you have now?&rdquo; she
asked tentatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that is impossible. It takes much time to
make the <i>ollas</i>, and the men say they come back
in three or four days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three or four days,&rdquo; Jo Ann thought. &ldquo;I
hope Florence comes on one of those days, so
we&rsquo;ll have an excuse to come down here to meet
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy broke into her thoughts with, &ldquo;Ask her
the price of these jars. They&rsquo;re lovely.&rdquo; She
picked up two jars, each attractively decorated
with a design of cactus and Spanish dagger.</p>
<p>Jo Ann relayed this question to the woman.
&ldquo;How much do you sell these for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman went on to tell the price of each&mdash;an
absurdly small amount, not a third as much
as they were worth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that what those men pay you for them?&rdquo;
Jo Ann asked incredulously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>S&iacute;.</i>&rdquo; The woman nodded.</p>
<p>Jo Ann repeated the price to Peggy, adding,
&ldquo;Those men are robbers, as well as&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She left her sentence unfinished and turned
back to the woman, saying, &ldquo;They do not pay you
enough. I will give you twice that much for these
two <i>ollas</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s eyes opened wide. &ldquo;Ah&mdash;that is
good. I have much need of money to buy food
for my children.&rdquo; She hesitated a moment, then
added, &ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, I will let you have these two. The
men will be angry, but then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She shrugged
her shoulders expressively.</p>
<p>Jo Ann&rsquo;s mind was working rapidly. Perhaps
she could help this poor woman to market more
of her pottery. Florence had a friend who purchased
Mexican curios for a firm in the States.
She would tell Florence about this woman&rsquo;s pottery.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take these two <i>ollas</i>. Don&rsquo;t let those
men have all your pottery after this. I will sell it
for you at this price.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>After Jo Ann had paid for the jars and had
promised the woman again to help sell more of
the pottery for her, Peggy remarked as they
were starting away, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you paid that
woman more for the <i>ollas</i>, but I&rsquo;m afraid those
men&rsquo;ll be furious when they find out you&rsquo;re
buying her pottery at double the price they pay.
You&rsquo;re heading for trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann&rsquo;s face grew grave. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised,
but I&rsquo;m glad just the same that I could
help that family. Those poor little children look
half starved to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They surely do,&rdquo; Peggy agreed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X
<br /><span class="small">THE INDEFINITE MA&Ntilde;ANA</span></h2>
<p>As soon as Jo Ann woke the third morning
after their trip to the village, she reminded
Peggy that they must go back without fail today.
&ldquo;You know Florence said she&rsquo;d either be there
by noon, or that there&rsquo;d be a letter telling exactly
when to expect her. It all depended, she said,
on which day her father had to go to the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy half smiled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the only reason
you want to go to the village. You want to get
another look at those smugglers and get some information
about them; now, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I want to be able to give the straight
facts to the mystery man&mdash;if I ever see him
again. I want to find out how often those men
come to the village&mdash;where they go on their trips
farther into the interior&mdash;what it is they&rsquo;re smuggling&mdash;exactly
what route they take on their way
back to the border, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think you are&mdash;a glorified kind
of Sherlock or a whole detective agency?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither. Only I think we&rsquo;ve bumped into a
fascinating mystery that&rsquo;s daring us to solve it.
I want to play safe, but if we can get any information
that&rsquo;ll aid in catching that band of smugglers
and maybe help keep the mystery man from
losing his life, I certainly want to get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t get too venturesome. I&rsquo;ve
known you to get too enthusiastic about your
mystery-solving. One good thing, Jos&eacute; will go
with us to the village. He&rsquo;ll be our bodyguard
without knowing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the girls&rsquo; relief Miss Prudence gave her
permission for them to accompany Jos&eacute; to the
village again. They were ready and waiting impatiently
for him several minutes before he
appeared with the horses and an extra pack
burro.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid those smugglers&rsquo;ll have come for
the pottery and gone before we get to the village,
at this rate,&rdquo; Jo Ann fumed while she was waiting.</p>
<p>Peggy grinned. &ldquo;So much the better for us. I,
for one, never want to see them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to find out their plans some way or
other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As before, they rode down the mountain, then
left their horses and the burro at the rough
thatched shed where their car was stored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give this shed a name,&rdquo; Peggy suggested
as they climbed into the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Jo Ann agreed. &ldquo;How about calling
it Jitters&rsquo; House? That&rsquo;s what it is now. It&rsquo;s
the first time the garage was so far away that I
had to ride horseback to get to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy smiled. &ldquo;Hereafter, then, this is Jitters&rsquo;
House.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On nearing the Mexican woman&rsquo;s shack Jo
Ann began looking eagerly to see if the pottery
were still piled up beside it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;The pottery&rsquo;s still
there. That means the men haven&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She
stopped in the middle of her sentence. Jos&eacute; was
beginning to understand English much better
now that he was staying at Mr. Eldridge&rsquo;s home,
and so might be able to get an inkling of what
she was talking about.</p>
<p>As it was, Peggy understood, since Jo Ann had
been worrying all the way down the mountain
lest the pottery and the men should be gone.</p>
<p>Jo Ann drove straight to Pedro&rsquo;s store, the
scheduled meeting place again, as it had been the
day they had all driven from the city. There was
no sign of Florence&rsquo;s small trim figure to be seen
outside the store or inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;re too early,&rdquo; Peggy suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to wait for the mail, anyway&mdash;it
hasn&rsquo;t come yet, Pedro said,&rdquo; Jo Ann replied. &ldquo;If
there isn&rsquo;t a letter from her, we&rsquo;ll know she&rsquo;s
coming and will wait till she appears. This delay
suits me to a T.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I know it! You&rsquo;re just aching for those
old smugglers to appear while we&rsquo;re here. I hope
they don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>Undisturbed, Jo Ann went on, &ldquo;While we&rsquo;re
waiting, let&rsquo;s you and me go back to that shack
and find out if any of the family knows exactly
when the men are coming after the pottery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We-ell, I s&rsquo;pose there couldn&rsquo;t be any danger
about asking a few questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy climbed back into the car with Jo Ann,
leaving Jos&eacute; squatting on the sidewalk smoking
his corn-shuck cigarette and chatting with a
group of his peon friends.</p>
<p>When they stopped in front of the shack, they
noticed a little dark-eyed girl, the tallest of the
stair-step children she had seen previously,
standing close to the piles of pottery. Jo Ann
promptly leaped out of the car and walked over
and began admiring the pottery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>ollas</i> are very beautiful,&rdquo; she said in her
slow Spanish. &ldquo;Did you help to decorate them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>S&iacute;</i>, I fix this one.&rdquo; She picked up a small,
brightly colored jar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is lovely,&rdquo; admired Jo Ann. &ldquo;You are very
artistic.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s black eyes shone, and two dimples
twinkled in her olive-tinted cheeks at this praise.</p>
<p>After she had looked at the pottery a few minutes
longer, Jo Ann asked haltingly, &ldquo;Do you
know when the men are coming for your <i>ollas</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>S&iacute;</i>,&rdquo; the girl nodded, her long black braids
swaying with the motion. &ldquo;They tell my papa
they come <i>ma&ntilde;ana</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ma&ntilde;ana</i>,&rdquo; Jo repeated to herself discouragedly.
That was the most indefinite word in the
Spanish language. It might mean tomorrow, and
it might mean any time in months to come. &ldquo;Do
you mean Friday?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>S&iacute;</i>, Friday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;Maybe in
the morning; maybe in the afternoon&mdash;I do not
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time did they come last time they
bought your pottery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child shook her head. &ldquo;I do not remember.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>Just then the girl&rsquo;s mother appeared in the
doorway and smiled broadly on recognizing Jo
Ann and Peggy.</p>
<p>Jo Ann walked over to the door and, after exchanging
greetings with her, asked if she knew
exactly when the men were coming after the
pottery, ending, &ldquo;Maybe they will sell me some
more of your beautiful <i>ollas</i> when they come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman answered with the same gesture
as had her daughter&mdash;a shrug of her shoulders
and, &ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do they usually come?&rdquo; Jo Ann persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last time they come about this hour. They
stop at Pedro&rsquo;s store first; then they come here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann&rsquo;s eyes brightened. At last she had secured
a bit of information.</p>
<p>As it turned out, this was the only piece forthcoming.
Question after question brought forth
only the inevitable but expressive shrug of the
shoulders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>Though she could see Jo Ann was discouraged,
Peggy could not help smiling and asking
teasingly, &ldquo;Have you learned yet what this
means?&rdquo; She raised her eyebrows and shrugged
her shoulders in true Mexican style.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silly!&rdquo; Jo Ann exploded. The next moment
she grinned and replied, &ldquo;It means anything
and everything. I&rsquo;m going to cultivate that gesture
myself and use it when anyone tries to quiz
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they reached the store, the mail had arrived
and in it a letter from Florence.</p>
<p>Jo Ann tore open the envelope quickly,
glanced over the short note, and handed it to
Peggy, saying, &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be here tomorrow afternoon&mdash;and
so&rsquo;ll we be here.&rdquo; To herself she
added that there might be two others who probably
would not be very comfortable persons to
have near.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI
<br /><span class="small">THE SECRET OF THE OLLA</span></h2>
<p>The girls had thought that as usual Jos&eacute; would
accompany them to the village the next day. As
it happened, however, there was some extra work
for him to do about the mine, and Mr. Eldridge
decided to send Carlitos and Pepito as escorts for
them in place of Jos&eacute;. &ldquo;Each boy can ride a
horse, and then on the way back they can ride
double, as they did the first day, and let Florence
have the extra horse,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; Jo Ann exclaimed.</p>
<p>Peggy was silent. The thought had darted into
her mind that if those smugglers should chance
to be in the village at the same time that they
were, it would be more comfortable to have Jos&eacute;
along instead of the boys.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>When they reached Jitters&rsquo; House, the boys
suddenly decided to stay there and wait for the
girls. &ldquo;Pepito and I are going to build a dam
in this stream,&rdquo; Carlitos explained, gesturing
toward the small stream near by.</p>
<p>When a half hour later the girls passed the
pottery woman&rsquo;s shack without seeing any sign
of the smugglers&rsquo; car, Peggy breathed a little
more freely. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll probably leave before they
get here,&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>As if in answer to her thoughts, Jo Ann spoke
up briskly, &ldquo;I see where we&rsquo;ll have to wait
around the village till those men come. Since the
pottery&rsquo;s still there, I know they haven&rsquo;t come
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wouldn&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; Peggy answered
quickly. &ldquo;We might have to stay so long it&rsquo;d be
dark before we&rsquo;d get back to the mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we can&rsquo;t wait that long. I&rsquo;m in
hopes they&rsquo;ll come soon, but I want to see them
if I possibly can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they came in sight of Pedro&rsquo;s store, they
saw Florence standing out in front, looking up
the narrow street.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Attaboy! There she is!&rdquo; cried Jo Ann.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She sees us now!&rdquo; Peggy waved both arms
vigorously, a gesture that was answered equally
enthusiastically by Florence.</p>
<p>As soon as the three girls had exchanged the
warmest of greetings and Florence and her baggage
were settled in the car, Jo Ann broke into
an account of having seen the smugglers&rsquo; car, and
all the other details.</p>
<p>Florence was indignant over the ridiculously
low price the men were paying the villagers for
their pottery. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Jo. Those men are
thieves,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re making three or four
hundred per cent profit on the pottery, to say
nothing of what they&rsquo;re getting out of their
smuggling. I believe I can pay that woman and
the other villagers more than you did for their
<i>ollas</i>, and ship them to the States, and still break
even. When I see these poverty-stricken women
with their big families to feed and clothe, I feel
I&rsquo;ve got to help them every chance I get.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, too,&rdquo; agreed Jo Ann.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; added Peggy. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to
get those smugglers angry at us. They&rsquo;ll be furious
when they find out you&rsquo;re planning to buy
all the pottery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both Jo Ann and Florence were silent a moment;
then Jo Ann remarked, &ldquo;Maybe we hadn&rsquo;t
better buy all the pottery, because if we do, the
men&rsquo;ll stop coming here altogether, and I won&rsquo;t
get a chance to find out more about them to tell
the mystery man. I want to help him&mdash;his life&rsquo;s
at stake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence nodded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so.&rdquo; She turned to
Peggy then with, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. We&rsquo;d better buy
only a few pieces of pottery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s drive past the shack now and see if the
smugglers&rsquo; car is there,&rdquo; Jo Ann suggested, starting
the car even as she spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right with me if you&rsquo;ll keep on
driving and not stop,&rdquo; Peggy spoke up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>Jo Ann drove very slowly past the pottery
woman&rsquo;s house, but there was no sign of any kind
of car to be seen. As the pottery was still there,
she knew the men were yet to come. She drove on
a short distance, then turned into a rough road
circling into the village. To Peggy&rsquo;s disapproval
she turned again a few minutes later into the
side road leading past the woman&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Almost simultaneously Jo Ann and Florence
caught sight of the old car parked beside the
house. &ldquo;The smugglers&rsquo; car!&rdquo; they both gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn as fast as you can and get away from
here,&rdquo; ordered Peggy.</p>
<p>Instead of obeying her command Jo Ann drew
the car to the side of the road and stopped. &ldquo;You
stay in the car, Peggy, while Florence and I see
if we can find out anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do be careful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With Peggy&rsquo;s last words in their minds Jo Ann
and Florence approached the shack cautiously,
coming up close to the back of the house, where
they halted. Though they could not see the smugglers
and the woman except by peeping around
the corner of the shack, they could hear them
talking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re trying to make her come down on the
price, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; Jo Ann whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; trying to force her down to a mere fraction
of what the <i>ollas</i> are worth.&rdquo; An angry glint
came into Florence&rsquo;s blue eyes. &ldquo;I feel like
marching right out and telling her not to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
She stopped whispering to listen to the woman&rsquo;s
plaintive reply that she needed the money for
food for her children.</p>
<p>Jo Ann caught the woman&rsquo;s words and their
meaning. &ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s see if we can&rsquo;t persuade
or bluff them into giving more money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without hesitating, Florence stepped out, and
together the two marched on around to where
the men and the woman were standing.</p>
<p>At their approach the two swarthy-skinned
men looked up in surprise. The taller one, who
was a little squint-eyed and had a scar on his
chin, drew his brows together into a deep frown
as he peered from under his sombrero at Jo Ann.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>Involuntarily Jo Ann caught her breath as the
thought darted into her mind that he looked as
if he recognized her. &ldquo;Perhaps he saw me there
in the gully,&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>By that time Florence was talking to the
woman in rapid Spanish, offering to buy all her
pottery at almost three times more than the men
had offered.</p>
<p>The taller man whirled about to stare at Florence
and to scowl more fiercely than ever. &ldquo;It is
impossible for you to buy the <i>ollas</i>. She promise
us all&mdash;everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence ignored this remark and asked the
woman, &ldquo;How much did they say in the first
place that they would pay you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Between sobs the woman replied and added,
&ldquo;Now they say they will give me only half of
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since they won&rsquo;t pay you what they had
promised, then sell your pottery to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both men broke into a torrent of protests, waving
their arms and shaking their heads violently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>While they were absorbed in arguing with
Florence, Jo Ann gradually edged over and
looked into the back of the car, the bottom of
which was filled with pottery packed in straw.
After one hasty glance over her shoulder at the
men, she reached over and pulled out a large
<i>olla</i> from the middle.</p>
<p>How heavy it was! She peered into it, then
thrust her hand inside. There was a package&mdash;a
heavy one&mdash;at the bottom.</p>
<p>Just then a furious voice rang out, &ldquo;Put that
<i>olla</i> back in the car!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She wheeled about to see the shorter one of
the men rushing angrily toward her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII
<br /><span class="small">HEADING FOR TROUBLE</span></h2>
<p>In another moment the man had grabbed the
<i>olla</i> out of Jo Ann&rsquo;s hand and had placed it back
in its nest of straw in the car. &ldquo;What are you
doing?&rdquo; he demanded sharply, edging between
her and the car. &ldquo;Leave these alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann detected a note of alarm in his voice.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s afraid I&rsquo;ve discovered the contents of that
<i>olla</i>,&rdquo; she thought. Determined to conceal her
nervousness, she replied in as cool and controlled
a voice as she could muster, &ldquo;How much will
you take for that <i>olla</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man shook his head. &ldquo;No&mdash;no. It is not
for sale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will give you fifty <i>centavos</i> for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no. I cannot sell it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how about seventy-five <i>centavos</i>, then?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>The merest shadow of a smile began to spread
over the man&rsquo;s dark, unshaven face. Perhaps
here was a chance for him to make a few extra
<i>centavos</i>, and no one would be the wiser. He
reached down in the car and after rummaging
about for a few moments drew up another <i>olla</i>
similar to the one Jo Ann had picked up. &ldquo;Here&mdash;I
let you have it,&rdquo; he said, offering it to her.</p>
<p>Jo Ann shook her head. &ldquo;No, that is not the
one I want. It is this one.&rdquo; She started to lean
over the car, but the man stopped her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, this is the only one I have to sell,&rdquo; he
insisted. &ldquo;See, it is beautiful! Seventy-five <i>centavos</i>
is very cheap. I do not make anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheap!&rdquo; Jo Ann flung back at him, her eyes
blazing. In her anger she had forgotten to be
cautious. &ldquo;I heard what you&rsquo;re paying for these
<i>ollas</i>. You are a thief. Pay them more money, or
I&rsquo;ll buy them all myself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>He scowled menacingly at her. &ldquo;Ah, it was
you who put evil things into that woman&rsquo;s head&mdash;demanding
more money! They are lucky to
get that much. Do not interfere with my business
again. <i>Sabe?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before she could reply, the other man stepped
up, an angry glint snapping in his eyes along
with that same half-puzzled expression, as if he
were still undecided about her identity. The two
men exchanged a few whispered sentences so
rapidly that she could not make out a single
word. Every now and then they glanced in her
direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re furious at me,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want them to stop coming to the village. I&rsquo;d better
not say another word.&rdquo; She glanced over at
Florence, who was motioning to her to leave.
&ldquo;Florence has come to the same conclusion. Time
we&rsquo;re leaving this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She walked over to Florence, and after both
had bade the woman and her children &ldquo;<i>Adios</i>,&rdquo;
they started off down the road toward their car.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Those men are watching us,&rdquo; Jo Ann remarked
a few minutes later, after a swift backward
glance over her shoulder. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want
them to get so angry that they&rsquo;ll stop coming to
the village, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. That&rsquo;s why I told the woman I could
buy only a part of their pottery.&rdquo; A satisfied
smile passed over Florence&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I hope that&rsquo;ll
force those men to pay more. They&rsquo;re very anxious
to keep on buying here, because this village
makes unusually good pottery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their designs are beautiful. I think they&rsquo;ll
keep on coming here.&rdquo; Jo Ann looked back over
her shoulder again before adding, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re still
watching us. Did you notice how that taller one
kept staring at me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence nodded. &ldquo;It made me wonder if he&rsquo;d
seen you when you so foolishly ran up the side of
that gully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how was I going to be able to recognize
them if I hadn&rsquo;t seen them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they reached their car, Peggy began
hurling questions at them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Florence&rsquo;ll tell you everything,&rdquo; Jo Ann said
as she started the car quickly and turned up the
rough road toward the city, adding, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m heading
toward the city so those men won&rsquo;t know
where we live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After she had gone a short distance, she wound
back out of the village by the rough back streets.
When she finally cut back onto the main road, she
threw an anxious look back up the road toward
the village. There was no sign of a car to be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We fooled them,&rdquo; she said, well pleased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe we did,&rdquo; agreed Florence. &ldquo;They
probably think we live in the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When, two hours later, the girls and the two
boys reached the mine, the girls had completely
recovered from their nervousness over their encounter
with the smugglers.</p>
<p>Florence was enthusiastic over the attractive
appearance and cleanliness of the great stone
house, which of course delighted Miss Prudence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While you are here, Florence,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll
all have to make a trip to the city to buy materials
for draperies and couch and pillow covers
to brighten up this gloomy old house. It still
reminds me of a barracks, even if it is clean.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;ll be fine,&rdquo; approved Florence,
exchanging pleased glances with Jo Ann and
Peggy. &ldquo;We all love to go to the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the three Jo Ann was the most delighted.
She must get to the city and find the mystery
man, especially now that she had some more information
about the smugglers. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we go
tomorrow, Miss Prudence?&rdquo; she asked eagerly.</p>
<p>Miss Prudence shook her head. &ldquo;No. I want to
finish all the cleaning first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the house is spotless now,&rdquo; Jo Ann protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The kitchen is a downright disgrace. Why
Maria insists on using that old fireplace to cook
on when she has this new range, I can&rsquo;t understand.
It makes such a mess. I told her I wanted
that fireplace closed up. I want some shelves put
up, too. There isn&rsquo;t any place to store our supplies.
This kitchen wasn&rsquo;t built for convenience.
It&rsquo;s big as all outdoors, but there&rsquo;s no place to
put anything.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Maria!&rdquo; thought Jo Ann. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll never
understand Miss Prudence&rsquo;s ideas of a modern
kitchen. She feels that the kitchen is her domain
and won&rsquo;t like any interference. We&rsquo;ll have all
we can do to keep peace in the family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to take Florence around the camp
tomorrow and show her all the improvements,&rdquo;
Peggy spoke up. She turned to Florence. &ldquo;Mr.
Eldridge&rsquo;s had all the miners&rsquo; ugly little shacks
replaced with stone houses built of the natural
stone from the quarry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I noticed a few of them as we came up.
I&rsquo;m so glad. It worried me to see the contrast
between those horrible shacks and this great
stone house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be delighted to see the modern machinery
they&rsquo;ve put in the mine, too,&rdquo; Jo Ann put
in. &ldquo;They use electricity now for a good deal of
the work, and that makes it lots easier on the
miners&mdash;less dangerous, too. Mr. Eldridge&rsquo;s
promised to show us around tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo; Florence&rsquo;s face was aglow on hearing
of these improvements. She was as happy as the
other girls to hear how the drudgery and squalor
had been removed from the miners&rsquo; lives since
Mr. Eldridge had taken over the management
of the mining company of which Carlitos was
the chief stockholder. As all three girls owned
stock in the company&mdash;a gift for their share in
recovering the mine for him&mdash;they felt a personal
responsibility for improving conditions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to go with us on our ride
about the camp tomorrow?&rdquo; Jo Ann asked Miss
Prudence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve been wanting to ever since I came,
but I&rsquo;ve been so busy, you know. I&rsquo;ll get an early
start at cleaning tomorrow morning, so I can go
with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An amused expression slipped into each girl&rsquo;s
face at the familiar words &ldquo;an early start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was that, immediately after the siesta
hour, the girls and Miss Prudence set out on
horseback on a general inspection trip of the
mining camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t have time to go down into the mine
this time,&rdquo; Miss Prudence said as they rode off.
&ldquo;Ed says that he wants us to go all through it
soon, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re very anxious to go down into the mine,
aren&rsquo;t we, girls?&rdquo; said Jo Ann.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We surely are,&rdquo; both replied.</p>
<p>With the greatest satisfaction Jo Ann and
Peggy pointed out the rows of neat, substantial
limestone houses, each one very homelike with
flowers and vines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Mexicans love beauty,&rdquo; Florence remarked
to Miss Prudence as they passed a house
one side of which was covered with a bougainvillea
vine aflame with pinkish purple flowers.
The tiny yard was a riot of color, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve noticed that they are very fond of
flowers,&rdquo; Miss Prudence agreed. &ldquo;Carlitos told
me today that Maria had asked him if I&rsquo;d
brought some flower seed with me&mdash;that she
wanted to see if she could grow some new kinds
of flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>Jo Ann, who had been listening to their conversation,
now called out, &ldquo;That reminds me,
let&rsquo;s dig up some ferns and cactus&mdash;that kind
that has bright red blossoms&mdash;this afternoon and
plant them in our pottery jars. And let&rsquo;s make a
rock garden in the patio, too, and plant all the
different kinds of cacti we can find.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A grand idea,&rdquo; the girls agreed, and Miss
Prudence nodded approvingly.</p>
<p>As they approached the mine opening, Jo Ann
proudly pointed out the electric tram-cars which
were used to carry the ore down the steep incline,
instead of the burros, as formerly. &ldquo;The
biggest improvement of all, though, is the way
they get the ore out of the mine. Mr. Eldridge
has promised to take us down there some time
soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After leaving the mine they rode a short distance
on up the beautiful winding mountain
trail, then reluctantly turned at Miss Prudence&rsquo;s
suggestion and started homeward. Before leaving
the trail, however, they persuaded her to
wait while they dismounted and dug up some
cactus and resurrection plants.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This cactus&rsquo;ll look lovely in that big jar with
the cactus design on it,&rdquo; Peggy explained to
Miss Prudence. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll love to watch these
resurrection plants. You can keep them out of
water for months, till they&rsquo;re dried, dead-looking
balls, then put them into water, and they&rsquo;ll unfold
and become green and beautiful again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again, when they were crossing the crystal
clear stream that ran near the house, they
begged Miss Prudence to halt. &ldquo;Wait for us
while we dig up some of these exquisite wild
maidenhair ferns,&rdquo; Jo Ann urged, an appeal that
the other two promptly echoed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Miss Prudence agreed, halting
under the shade of a rocky cliff over which
trickled a tiny silver ribbon of water into a fern-edged
pool.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>Peggy began pulling up some of the ferns
close by, but Jo Ann remarked, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear to
spoil the beauty of this pool by taking any more
of these ferns. Let&rsquo;s go up the stream a little
farther, Florence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann and Florence walked on along the
stream in silent admiration and soon disappeared
around a great moss-covered boulder.</p>
<p>Suddenly Florence caught sight of a short
chunky figure of a man just ahead. She gasped
aloud. Simultaneously Jo Ann&rsquo;s lower jaw
dropped, and her eyes opened wide. The next
instant the man clambered up the side of the cliff
and disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the smugglers!&rdquo; whispered Jo Ann,
finally recovering her speech. &ldquo;He was spying
on us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one that grabbed the <i>olla</i> from you,&rdquo;
Florence breathed. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hurry back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls wheeled about and ran back down
the stream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII
<br /><span class="small">THE POTTERY WOMAN&rsquo;S WARNING</span></h2>
<p>On coming in sight of Miss Prudence and
Peggy, the two girls checked their steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t mention seeing that man before
Miss Prudence,&rdquo; Jo Ann warned. &ldquo;No use
alarming her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Florence agreed. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t
act as if he were dangerous, anyway. He ran,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t want us to see him&mdash;to recognize
him. What&rsquo;s he doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence shook her head, puzzled. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
imagine. The pottery woman said they always
went on to the city after getting the pottery.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>All at once it dawned upon Jo Ann that they
had not got any ferns and would soon be back
at the pool empty-handed. &ldquo;Miss Prudence&rsquo;ll
wonder why we didn&rsquo;t get some ferns,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s stop this minute and pull up some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few more minutes they had carefully
pulled up some clumps of the daintiest maidenhair
specimens in sight and had wrapped elephant-ear
leaves about their roots to keep the
leaf mold from falling off.</p>
<p>When they neared the pool Peggy called out,
&ldquo;What&rsquo;d you see to make you come flying back
so fast&mdash;a rattlesnake or a boa constrictor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Er&mdash;neither,&rdquo; Florence replied.</p>
<p>To her and Jo Ann&rsquo;s relief Miss Prudence
asked quickly, &ldquo;Are there really boa constrictors
around here? Did you ever see one here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not right here,&rdquo; Florence replied guardedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Close here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;fifty miles or so to the south.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hop on your horses and let&rsquo;s go this minute.&rdquo;
Miss Prudence tapped her boot against her
mount&rsquo;s flank and started riding down the
path.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>In a few minutes the three girls were following.</p>
<p>After Miss Prudence had gone out of hearing
distance, Peggy rode over close to Jo Ann and
demanded, &ldquo;What did you girls see to scare you
that way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann leaned over and whispered, &ldquo;One of
the smugglers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy gave a little sudden start that made her
horse quiver responsively. &ldquo;Gol-ly!&rdquo; she ejaculated.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;d he come up here for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what Florence and I want to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time the girls had reached the house,
Miss Prudence had dismounted and had gone
inside.</p>
<p>As they were walking along the corridor to
their room Maria hurried out of the kitchen,
an excited gleam in her black eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>After a swift glance around to assure herself
that Miss Prudence was not in sight she called
to Florence in a low voice and motioned for all
three of them to come there. As they drew near
she went on excitedly, &ldquo;There is a woman here
from San Geronimo to see you. She say she has
something to tell the se&ntilde;oritas who bought her
<i>ollas</i> a few days back. It is very important, she
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A woman from San Geronimo to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Florence
checked her flow of Spanish to relay the
message in English to Peggy and Jo Ann.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must think it&rsquo;s important to come &rsquo;way
up here,&rdquo; Jo Ann murmured to Florence as they
followed Maria and Peggy into the kitchen.
&ldquo;Do you suppose it could be something about
those&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before she could finish her sentence, they were
inside the kitchen. There sitting beside the door
talking to Jos&eacute; was the woman from whom Jo
Ann had bought the pottery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>On seeing Jo and Florence the woman rose
and hurried over to meet them. With her words
tumbling over each other in her excitement, she
began talking to Florence. So rapid was her
Spanish that Jo Ann could catch only a few
words now and then. One thing she was sure of,
however, was that the woman was frightened.
But why? She could stand the suspense no longer
and broke in, &ldquo;What is it, Florence? What&rsquo;s the
trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence turned and explained quickly to her
and Peggy, &ldquo;She says she heard the smugglers
threaten to get even with you and me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann&rsquo;s eyes flew open, but she repressed the
frightened exclamation on the tip of her tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her oldest girl overheard one of the men tell
the other that they&rsquo;d find out at Pedro&rsquo;s store
where we lived,&rdquo; Florence went on; &ldquo;then that
he&rsquo;d drive on with the load of pottery and let
him wait around here for a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s why that man&rsquo;s here&mdash;to get even
with us!&rdquo; Jo Ann exclaimed. &ldquo;That means we&rsquo;ll
have to be extremely careful for a few days. Did
she say when the other man&rsquo;d be back at the
village?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I&rsquo;ll ask her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>After questioning her closely Florence relayed
her answers to the girls. &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t know. Says
she thinks he&rsquo;ll come one day soon&mdash;maybe about
this time next week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The vague <i>ma&ntilde;ana</i>,&rdquo; Peggy summed up.
&ldquo;That means we&rsquo;ll be sitting on top of a volcano
for no telling how long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so thankful we know of the volcano&rsquo;s existence,&rdquo;
Jo Ann replied. She smiled over at the
woman with a &ldquo;<i>Muchas gracias</i>. You have been
very kind to walk all this way to tell us about the
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence, too, joined in thanking her, then
began talking to the anxious-faced Maria. She
could see she was worried even more than they
themselves. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Maria. Jos&eacute; won&rsquo;t let
anything happen to us. Will you, Jos&eacute;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Miss Florencita. I will take care of
you. But you and Miss Jo and Miss Peggy must
be very careful. Stay here at the house unless I
am with you. Shall I tell Mr. Eldridge about
this?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;well, not yet, anyway.&rdquo; Jo Ann put in
hastily. She must get the information to the
mystery man, and if she stayed a prisoner in this
house all the time, she couldn&rsquo;t get the chance.
Mr. Eldridge might not even want her and the
girls and Miss Prudence to go to the city, if he
knew about this man&rsquo;s threat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jos&eacute;, you haven&rsquo;t gone after the mail yet, have
you?&rdquo; Florence asked.</p>
<p>Jos&eacute; shook his head. &ldquo;I am leaving soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get a burro so this woman can ride home.
She must be very tired. I&rsquo;m sure Mr. Eldridge
will not object.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien.</i> I get the burro.&rdquo; He gestured to the
woman. &ldquo;Come with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait just a minute, Jos&eacute;,&rdquo; spoke up Jo Ann.
&ldquo;I want to give her something for her children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ran to her room and reappeared in a moment
carrying a large box of caramels. She
handed them to the woman, saying, &ldquo;Here are
some <i>dulces</i> for your children. We will come
back next week for some more <i>ollas</i>. You will
have some ready then?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>The woman nodded.</p>
<p>Both Maria and the girls felt relieved after
the woman and Jos&eacute; had gone without Miss Prudence&rsquo;s
seeing her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have had to tell Miss Prudence everything
from A to Z about that woman if she&rsquo;d seen
her,&rdquo; declared Jo Ann. She turned to Maria.
&ldquo;You must not let Miss Prudence know anything
about what this woman said. <i>Sabe</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;I will not. I know nothing,&rdquo; Maria replied
with emphasis, then shrugging her shoulders
added, &ldquo;Miss Prudencia no speak the Spanish.
I no speak the English.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if they did speak the same language,
Maria wouldn&rsquo;t confide in her,&rdquo; Jo Ann thought.
&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t understand each other. Neither one
knows how good and kind the other is. Why is it
that women living under the same roof are so
often antagonistic to each other?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>Almost the same moment Miss Prudence entered
the kitchen, gave Maria a few orders, with
Florence as interpreter, then added in a suspicious
tone, &ldquo;I noticed a Mexican woman just
leaving the house with a box in her hands. What
did Maria give her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Florence replied quickly. &ldquo;Jo Ann
gave her a box of caramels for her children.
She&rsquo;s the woman Jo Ann bought the jars from.
I&rsquo;m going to get some more from her and from
the other villagers and ship them to my friend
in St. Louis, who has a curio shop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Miss Prudence changed the subject to
a discussion of the menu for supper, all three
girls were relieved.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV
<br /><span class="small">JO ANN&rsquo;S SEARCH</span></h2>
<p>It was not till after they had gone to bed that
night that the girls had an opportunity to talk
over the woman&rsquo;s story and Jo Ann&rsquo;s and Florence&rsquo;s
discovery of the smuggler&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m certainly glad you had my bed put in
your room,&rdquo; Florence remarked, reaching over
across the narrow space that separated her bed
from the girls&rsquo; double one and patting Jo Ann&rsquo;s
hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be scared to sleep in one of these huge
old rooms by myself&mdash;especially knowing about
that smuggler&rsquo;s being around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m as tall as he is, so I&rsquo;m not scared of him,&rdquo;
grinned Jo Ann. &ldquo;If I were as small and lilylike
and fragile-looking as you, I might be uneasy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stop teasing me that way,&rdquo; laughed Florence,
&ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll roll over between you two for protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as they were about to drop off to sleep,
Jo Ann murmured drowsily, &ldquo;If Miss Prudence
dares to come in and wake me up early in the
morning with &lsquo;we&rsquo;ll have to get an early start&rsquo;&mdash;at
something or other, I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m going to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
She hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to what?&rdquo; jibed Peggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to fire my pillow at her, then turn
over and go back to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy giggled. &ldquo;Uh-huh! I see you firing a
pillow at her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As it happened, Miss Prudence did enter their
room early the next morning to waken them, but
instead of hurling a pillow Jo Ann listened
gladly to her plan for an &ldquo;early start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to the city&mdash;this morning?&rdquo; she repeated,
wide awake as soon as the phrase &ldquo;going
to the city&rdquo; had entered her brain. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine!
Sure we&rsquo;ll be ready by the time you are.&rdquo; Seeing
that Peggy was sufficiently awake now to take in
the plan for a trip to the city, she asked, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
be ready, won&rsquo;t you, Peg?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed. Reach over and wake Florence.
Tweak her ear or her nose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence protested vigorously at this manner
of being wakened but quickly subsided when Jo
Ann told her about the trip.</p>
<p>An hour later they were dressed and mounted
on their horses, as were Carlitos and Miss Prudence.
Jos&eacute; tied the two bags to his saddle, which
were the only pieces of luggage they were taking,
since they were to stay only one night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember, Carlitos,&rdquo; his uncle said smilingly
on telling him good-bye, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be the
man of the party after you reach Jitters&rsquo; House.
That&rsquo;s as far as Jos&eacute;&rsquo;ll go, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they reached Jitters&rsquo; House, Jos&eacute; placed
the bags in the car while the girls and Miss Prudence
changed from their riding clothes into outfits
more suitable for wear in the city. Miss Prudence
was neatness itself in her sheer black dress,
while the three girls looked fresh and lovely in
their linen suits and crisp dainty blouses, topped
off by pert little hats.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad the band will play on the Plaza
tonight,&rdquo; Peggy remarked after she had slipped
into the front seat beside Jo Ann, who was at the
wheel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad, too, but not for that reason,&rdquo; Jo
Ann replied. &ldquo;You want to promenade, while
I want to watch for&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She left her sentence
unfinished, but Peggy knew that it was
the mystery man for whom she would be looking.</p>
<p>When they neared the shack where the pottery
woman lived, Jo Ann looked eagerly to see if
there were any signs of the smugglers or their
car. &ldquo;Nothing doing,&rdquo; she said finally.</p>
<p>On nearing the city Florence took the wheel
on account of her knowledge of the city. After
eating a late lunch, they started out on their
shopping tour to buy draperies and other materials.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>Everywhere she went, whether in the car or
afoot, Jo Ann kept looking for the mystery man.
Every stalwart male of the mystery man&rsquo;s approximate
height whom she caught sight of she
studied intently, hoping that it would be he. She
begrudged the time spent inside shops buying
cretonnes and draperies, as she felt she would
never find him in such places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;ll be on that same corner of the
Plaza again,&rdquo; she comforted herself later that
evening after a fruitless search.</p>
<p>As soon as the band began playing, all three
girls made straight for the Plaza and began
promenading along with the gay groups of Mexican
girls, while Miss Prudence and Carlitos sat
watching from a bench on the outside of the
square.</p>
<p>As before, Jo Ann had eyes only for stalwart
onlookers who might turn out to be the mystery
man. Peggy, however, kept on the inside of the
line.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>When they had strolled about the square the
second time, Peggy suddenly uttered an exclamation
of surprise, &ldquo;There he is! There he
is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where? Where?&rdquo; Jo Ann asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&mdash;see? That tall, dark-haired, handsome
boy with the big black eyes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, gosh!&rdquo; Jo Ann ejaculated disgustedly
when she realized Peggy had not meant the mystery
man but the tall youth with whom she had
exchanged smiles the other time she had promenaded.</p>
<p>She was still more discouraged and disgusted
after a whole evening of strolling around the
Plaza with no sign of the mystery man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid this trip&rsquo;s going to be a complete
flop, after all,&rdquo; she remarked to Peggy. &ldquo;I might
as well have gone to the hotel when Miss Prudence
and Carlitos did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Prudence was an angel to let us stay so
long, wasn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; Peggy smiled.</p>
<p>Jo Ann nodded indifferently. Peggy might be
thrilled over exchanging smiles with a handsome
Mexican boy, but not she.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>The next morning, as soon as they left the
hotel to finish their shopping, Jo Ann began to
search for the mystery man again, but in vain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last thing we&rsquo;ll do is to go to the market,&rdquo;
Miss Prudence announced on leaving the department
store a little later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to the big market near the center of
the city,&rdquo; Florence suggested. &ldquo;You can buy
every kind of fruit and vegetable imaginable
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mystery man wouldn&rsquo;t be doing any marketing,&rdquo;
Jo Ann thought wearily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be no use
to look for him there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All at once a sudden thought struck her. If he
should have any inkling about the smugglers
hiding the dope or gold, or whatever stuff it was,
in jars and vases, he might stay around the pottery
booths where the pottery could be bought so
cheaply. She brightened visibly at this idea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>As soon as they reached the market, she left
the others with Miss Prudence in front of one of
the vegetable stands and wandered back to where
she had remembered seeing the pottery booth.
Eagerly her eyes roved here, there, and all around
the booths near by. That broad-shouldered man
standing&mdash;&mdash;She caught her breath. It was the
mystery man!</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s alive! He&rsquo;s alive!&rdquo; rang through her
mind; then the words, &ldquo;Now&rsquo;s my chance to
talk to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All at once it occurred to her that it would be
an embarrassing situation all around if Miss
Prudence should appear while she was talking to
this stranger. &ldquo;Before I say a word to him, I&rsquo;ll
slip back to tell Florence to keep Miss Prudence
and Carlitos away from the pottery booth for a
while,&rdquo; she thought quickly.</p>
<p>No sooner had this plan entered her mind
than she hurried to Florence&rsquo;s side, whispered a
few words, and waited only long enough to catch
her emphatic &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; then rushed back to
the pottery booth as fast as she could zigzag her
way through the crowded passageways.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>When she caught sight of the stalwart figure
again, she gave a sigh of relief and hastened
over toward him.</p>
<p>As she drew near, the man shot a piercing
glance at her, then a gleam of unmistakable
recognition shone in his keen gray eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t forgotten me,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;That
makes it easier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She began speaking in a low voice: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
trying to catch a band of smugglers, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man gave an involuntary start but controlled
his features. &ldquo;What makes you think
that?&rdquo; he countered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From what I overheard you say in the hotel&mdash;I
didn&rsquo;t mean to eavesdrop&mdash;and from a bit
of information I got from&mdash;&rdquo; she started to say
&ldquo;from a coast guard&rdquo; but changed to&mdash;&ldquo;from
somebody else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that somebody else a smuggler?&rdquo; he
asked in a carefully light tone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no.&rdquo; There was a hint of impatience in
Jo Ann&rsquo;s voice. He was trying to throw her off
the track. She&rsquo;d go straight to the point now.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve accidentally run across some information
about some smugglers that may help you,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>An alert expression replaced the half smile on
the man&rsquo;s face as he asked, &ldquo;What is that you
think you&rsquo;ve discovered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly Jo Ann recounted her and Florence&rsquo;s
discovery of the hidden car with the pottery and
the baskets near the border, the smugglers&rsquo; conversation,
and their seeing them again at the village,
ending with, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that must&rsquo;ve been
gold in that jar I lifted. It was so very heavy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks as if you&rsquo;ve discovered one set of
them,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re only two
of a large gang, though. The ringleaders stay on
the other side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it the ringleaders you&rsquo;d been pursuing
in Texas?&rdquo; she asked, low-voiced.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>He nodded. &ldquo;Dangerous men they are. If we
can catch them we can break up the gang. I&rsquo;m
going to keep an eye open for cars loaded with
baskets and pottery. If I can follow them to the
border I may be able to catch the leaders. Tell
me exactly where you discovered that hidden
car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann went on to describe as accurately as
possible the location of the gully in which she
and Florence had found the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you happen to know the license number
of their car?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; As she gave the number, he jotted it
down in a notebook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything else about the car to distinguish
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann went on to tell of the battered places
in the radiator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now give me a detailed description of
the men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Racking her brain for every item that would
be helpful, she described their appearance and
clothes, from the braided leather strips about
their sombreros to a peculiar squint in the left
eye of the taller man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good. You&rsquo;re a close observer, I wish you
could find out exactly when they&rsquo;ll leave San
Geronimo next week. If you could, I could wire
my men across the border. Maybe together we
might round up the ringleaders. If I don&rsquo;t get
them soon, they&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He halted abruptly, but Jo Ann knew instinctively
that he had been going to add &ldquo;get me.&rdquo;
That was what he had said over the telephone in
the hotel. She must&mdash;must get him that information
if possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to mix you girls up in this affair,
and if you can&rsquo;t get the information without endangering
yourselves, don&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann&rsquo;s eyes began to gleam determinedly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get it. As soon as we find out exactly when
the men&rsquo;re starting from the village, I&rsquo;ll get
word to you. If I can&rsquo;t come, I&rsquo;ll write you&mdash;but
where?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>The man took a card from his pocket and after
writing on it handed it to her, saying, &ldquo;Write me
in care of general delivery. I had decided to
leave in the morning, but now, since you&rsquo;ve given
me this very valuable information, I&rsquo;ll wait till
I hear from you. If you should come back to the
city, you&rsquo;ll find me somewhere around this pottery
booth in the daytime and near the Plaza at
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann was about to ask some more questions
when she caught a glimpse of Miss Prudence
and the girls coming down the crowded aisle.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go this instant,&rdquo; she said and hurried
around back of the booth, meeting them in the
main aisle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t missed you till a moment ago,&rdquo; Miss
Prudence remarked to her. &ldquo;What&rsquo;ve you been
buying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing&mdash;yet. I want to get a pair of Mexican
sandals to use for bedroom slippers. Have
you seen any here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; they&rsquo;re at a booth on the extreme left,&rdquo;
Florence put in quickly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you. Come
on, Peg. We&rsquo;ll meet you and Carlitos at that first
fruit booth, Miss Prudence, in a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV
<br /><span class="small">ANXIOUS MOMENTS</span></h2>
<p>As soon as Miss Prudence and Carlitos were
out of hearing distance, Florence asked eagerly,
&ldquo;Did you get to talk to the man, Jo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and he was glad to get the information.
He gave me his card. See? His name&rsquo;s Mr.
Andrews, and I&rsquo;m to write to him here in care
of general delivery. I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it when
we get back to the hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of this promise Jo Ann did not get an
opportunity to recount this conversation till
hours later.</p>
<p>After purchasing the sandals with much bargaining
in true Mexican style, Jo Ann and the
girls waited for some time at the fruit booth for
Miss Prudence and Carlitos.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what&rsquo;s happened to Miss Prudence
and Carlitos to keep them so long,&rdquo; Florence said
finally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know Miss Prudence&rsquo;s not delayed by carrying
on a conversation in Spanish with anyone,&rdquo;
smiled Peggy. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s like me&mdash;about the only
words she knows are <i>cuanto</i> and <i>adios</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she&rsquo;s bargaining by the gesture
method,&rdquo; added Jo Ann.</p>
<p>Several minutes later an anxious-faced Miss
Prudence came hurrying up and asked,
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Carlitos? Have you seen him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; all three replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s disappeared&mdash;was right by my
side one minute&mdash;then the next he was gone. I&rsquo;ve
searched all around the market but can&rsquo;t find
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve just missed each other in the crowds,&rdquo;
Florence replied comfortingly. &ldquo;You stay right
here, and we three&rsquo;ll separate and go in different
directions and meet here again. We&rsquo;ll find him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>Noticing an empty chair near by, Jo Ann
moved the chair over to Miss Prudence&rsquo;s side
and said, &ldquo;Sit here and rest. I&rsquo;m sure we girls
can find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wearily Miss Prudence sank down in the
chair, and the girls started off to find Carlitos.
Each took a different section of the building to
search and wound in and out the maze of
crowded passageways that divided the scores of
booths.</p>
<p>After Jo Ann had made the rounds of her
allotted part twice without seeing Carlitos, she
started back to Miss Prudence, hoping that the
other girls had found him. Peggy arrived almost
the same moment, but she, too, was alone.</p>
<p>The worried frown on Miss Prudence&rsquo;s face
deepened on seeing they had not found Carlitos.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence&rsquo;ll find him: she&rsquo;s more familiar
with this building,&rdquo; Jo Ann told her more confidently
than she felt. Into her mind had darted
the recollection of the harrowing experience they
had once had when Carlitos had been kidnaped
by the treacherous Mexican foreman. Just suppose
he&rsquo;d been kidnaped again! That one of those
smugglers had stolen him to get even with her
and Florence. That pottery woman had said they
had threatened to get even some way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>Just as she had come to this painful point in
her thoughts, Florence appeared&mdash;alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sign of him anywhere,&rdquo; she announced.
&ldquo;One man told me he&rsquo;d seen a boy of his description
going out a side door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he say this boy was alone?&rdquo; Jo Ann asked
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t say.&rdquo; Florence had caught Jo
Ann&rsquo;s emphasis on the word alone, and her heart
began thumping rapidly. Did Jo Ann think
someone might have kidnaped him again? The
smugglers! Could they&mdash;&mdash; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go back and ask
that man if Carlitos was alone,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>She hurried back to find the man and returned
a few moments later, saying in a disappointed
voice, &ldquo;He said he didn&rsquo;t notice whether he was
alone or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he got tired of waiting here and went
back to the hotel,&rdquo; Jo Ann suggested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He might have,&rdquo; Miss Prudence replied.
&ldquo;Florence, tell the woman at this booth&rdquo;&mdash;she
gestured to the booth just back of them&mdash;&ldquo;that
if she sees an American boy looking for somebody
to tell him we&rsquo;ve gone to the hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After another round of searching they left the
market and drove back to the hotel. Florence
parked the car near the side entrance, saying,
&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better leave the car here handy, as we&rsquo;ll
be leaving as soon as we can find Carlitos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They hurried into the hotel, looked about the
lobby, and then went up to their rooms. Carlitos
was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I declare, I&rsquo;m getting more and more worried&mdash;and
thoroughly exasperated,&rdquo; Miss Prudence
announced after looking in the last room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait here, Miss Prudence, and I&rsquo;ll run down
to the lobby and ask the clerks at the desk if
they&rsquo;ve seen him,&rdquo; Jo Ann said hurriedly. &ldquo;He
might&rsquo;ve left some message there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;I&rsquo;ll finish my packing while I&rsquo;m waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you, Jo,&rdquo; offered Florence and
Peggy together.</p>
<p>On inquiring at the desk Jo Ann found that
neither of the clerks had seen him.</p>
<p>As she was starting to turn away, one of the
clerks summoned the porter who stood at the
front entrance and asked him if he had seen Carlitos.
To the girls&rsquo; delight the porter nodded and
replied that he thought he had seen him talking
to a newsboy about half an hour ago.</p>
<p>The girls&rsquo; faces brightened on hearing this,
Jo Ann&rsquo;s especially, as she immediately recalled
how fascinated Carlitos had been with a Mexican
newsboy the first day they had arrived. After
a quick &ldquo;<i>Muchas gracias</i>&rdquo; to the porter, the girls
hurried out to the street, Jo Ann in the lead.</p>
<p>When they had walked only a short distance
down the street, Jo Ann heard a newsboy&rsquo;s shrill
cry in broken English. &ldquo;Carlitos&rsquo;s voice!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;I hear him!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>She rushed around the corner and stared
across the street. There, a bag of newspapers
slung across his shoulder, stood Carlitos selling
a paper to an American.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you beat that!&rdquo; Peggy ejaculated, catching
sight of Carlitos at the same time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all things!&rdquo; Florence gasped.</p>
<p>They hastened across the street to his side. He
greeted them half joyfully, half sheepishly; then,
with a gesture to the grinning little Mexican
newsboy beside him, he said, &ldquo;I sell lots of papers
for Diego. He say I very good &rsquo;cause I can speak
de Spanish and de English.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be good at selling papers, Carlitos,&rdquo;
Jo Ann answered, &ldquo;but you should&rsquo;ve told
your aunt Prudence where you were going. She&rsquo;s
been worried stiff about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worried stiff&mdash;stiff,&rdquo; he repeated, puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Badly worried&mdash;<i>mucho</i>. She&rsquo;s been afraid
something terrible had happened to you. Come
on to the hotel. We&rsquo;re leaving for the mine in a
few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reluctantly Carlitos parted with his newsboy
friend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>As soon as they had brought Carlitos to the
hotel room and Miss Prudence had delivered
him a strong lecture, she urged them all to hurry
and pack their few belongings and leave at once.
&ldquo;You know it&rsquo;s a long hard trip to the mine,
and I certainly don&rsquo;t want to be riding horseback
on that steep, rocky mountain trail after
dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t either,&rdquo; said Jo Ann quickly.
&ldquo;Florence and I had one experience riding in
the mountains in the dark and through a terrible
storm, too, and we don&rsquo;t want another, do we,
Florence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After leaving the city Florence slipped over
to let Jo Ann drive. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a better chauffeur
than I am and always make better time. We must
get back to the mine before dark, especially since
we saw&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She left her sentence unfinished, but Jo Ann
knew that she meant the smuggler they had seen
near the mine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>When they finally reached Jitters&rsquo; House in
the late afternoon, they found Jos&eacute; waiting for
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder why he happened to come?&rdquo; Peggy
remarked curiously on seeing him standing beside
the shed. The next instant she realized that
he must be uneasy because of the pottery
woman&rsquo;s account of the smugglers&rsquo; threats.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s come as an extra protection for us,&rdquo; she
thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good of him,&rdquo; Jo Ann put in, and Florence
added, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s always thoughtful and kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carlitos was delighted to see him. Another
male was a welcome change after having to stay
with women for two days. That was one reason
he had felt that he must slip off with the newsboy
awhile, though he couldn&rsquo;t have explained
that in words. He was eager to tell Jos&eacute; all about
his trip, too.</p>
<p>Even Miss Prudence expressed appreciation
of Jos&eacute;&rsquo;s coming, adding, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s as thoughtful as
he can be.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>Jo Ann was the first one of the group to finish
changing into riding clothes. She hurried back
to the shed where Jos&eacute; was still waiting, as she
was anxious to know how things had been running
at the mine, and especially if he had seen
anything of the smuggler hanging around. She
had described the smuggler so carefully to him
that he would be able to recognize him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen anything of that strange man
while we&rsquo;ve been gone?&rdquo; she asked him.</p>
<p>To her relief Jos&eacute; shook his head. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time Jos&eacute; shook his head more emphatically.
&ldquo;Ah&mdash;there was much trouble at the mine
today.&rdquo; With many excited gestures he went on
to tell her that one of the loaded tram-cars had
got loose and had crashed down the mountain
side, tearing up the track and causing much
trouble. &ldquo;Very much trouble,&rdquo; he repeated,
shaking his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What caused the car to break loose?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>Jos&eacute; shrugged his shoulders expressively.
&ldquo;That I do not know. Me no <i>sabe</i>. Se&ntilde;or Eldridge
say he no understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All at once the thought flashed into her mind
that perhaps the smuggler was at the bottom of
this accident. Maybe that was his way of getting
even.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI
<br /><span class="small">DOWN THE MINE SHAFT</span></h2>
<p>The next three days were busy ones for the
girls. Miss Prudence had bought scores of yards
of gay-colored cretonnes and other materials, and
she now set all three to work making couch and
pillow covers and draperies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to have draperies to hide the iron
bars at the bedroom windows,&rdquo; she had said. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t like to see those iron bars. They make me
feel as if I&rsquo;m in prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she escorted the girls to her bedroom
and showed them the heaps of materials, Jo Ann
remarked with a whimsical smile, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t realize
what I was getting us into when I suggested
brightening up this house with draperies and
cushions. It looks as if we&rsquo;ll be running the sewing
machine instead of Jitters for the next week
or two.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>Florence and Peggy both laughed. They knew
Jo Ann did not like any task that kept her in the
house, and especially one of the sitting-still kind,
like sewing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Outdoor action and plenty of it,&rsquo; is Jo Ann&rsquo;s
slogan,&rdquo; Peggy explained a moment later for
Miss Prudence&rsquo;s benefit. &ldquo;She says sitting still
and sewing make all her muscles feel cramped
and her head ache and her mind tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it does,&rdquo; Jo Ann defended. &ldquo;I feel as if
I&rsquo;m getting petrified. I&rsquo;d rather climb mountains
any time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you run the machine, then,&rdquo; Miss
Prudence spoke up briskly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll keep your
feet moving up and down as if you&rsquo;re climbing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A poor substitute,&rdquo; Jo Ann returned, smiling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Before you begin sewing, I&rsquo;ll give you an
active job that&rsquo;ll bring into use more of your
muscles&mdash;measuring windows. Be sure to get the
exact length. Nothing looks worse than draperies
that&rsquo;re too short.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Jo Ann had finished measuring windows,
she set to work basting and stitching the
hems in the draperies. By this time her thoughts
had wandered from sewing to the mystery man
and the smugglers. Was that smuggler still lurking
around the mine and had the other one
reached the border without being caught? And
was the mystery man still safe and sound? She
must get word someway to him when the smugglers
were to make their next trip, so he could
follow them. If only he could catch those ringleaders
and break up that gang!</p>
<p>So engrossed was she in these thoughts that
she did not heed Peggy&rsquo;s sudden outburst of
laughter several minutes later till Florence
called out a merry, &ldquo;Jo! Will you look what
you&rsquo;ve done! You&rsquo;ve hemmed all your draperies
upside down, so that the parrots or parrakeets&mdash;or
whatever kind of birds they are in the design&mdash;are
all standing on their heads.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll look comical with their tails perpetually
in the air,&rdquo; giggled Peggy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting
dizzy already even at the thought of those poor
birds hanging head downward that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear!&rdquo; groaned the discomfited Jo Ann
on viewing her mistake. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve got to rip out
every hem. Oh, woe is me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you,&rdquo; Florence offered, taking one
of the draperies from her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next time concentrate on your sewing instead
of on the mystery man and those&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
Peggy stopped talking abruptly on seeing Miss
Prudence enter the room.</p>
<p>As soon as Jos&eacute; came to the house that evening,
Jo Ann slipped to the kitchen to ask him
if he had seen the smuggler hanging around the
mine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>At his reply that he had not, Jo Ann felt relieved
till the next moment, when he added, &ldquo;We
have much trouble at the mine today. No get out
much ore.&rdquo; He went on to explain that the tram-car
wrecked the previous day had torn up the
track badly and that there had been trouble with
some of the mine machinery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have they found out who wrecked the car?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. One man told me he saw Luis, a bad
workman <i>El Se&ntilde;or</i> discharged last week, near
the track before the wreck.&rdquo; Jos&eacute; shrugged his
shoulders. &ldquo;I do not know who did it. Maybe it
was Luis&mdash;maybe it was the strange man you
saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did Mr. Eldridge discharge this Luis?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He steal ore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Miss Prudence entered the kitchen just
then and sat down, Jo Ann could not question
Jos&eacute; further. She left the room wondering if
after all she had not been wrong in her surmise
about the smuggler&rsquo;s having wrecked the car.
He might have become alarmed after she and
Florence had seen him and have left immediately.
She certainly hoped that was the case.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>By the time the girls had finished sewing, Jo
Ann was thoroughly weary of staying in the
house. &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t get outside for a long horseback
ride or a climb up the mountains today, I&rsquo;ll
go raving crazy,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Peggy laughed at this exaggerated speech, and
Florence remarked smilingly, &ldquo;Well, by all
means let&rsquo;s get out and explore the country this
afternoon. I&rsquo;m fed up with staying inside,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To tell you the truth,&rdquo; Peggy put in, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
been rather glad to stay inside. Ever since I
heard about that smuggler&rsquo;s hanging around
here, the house looks good to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s gone away by now, surely,&rdquo; Jo Ann
answered. &ldquo;Jos&eacute; says no one else has said a word
about having seen a stranger around, and in a
small camp like this a stranger surely couldn&rsquo;t
escape being noticed. I feel sure he&rsquo;s gone back
to join the other man. If that man returns for the
pottery the same time that he did last week, he&rsquo;ll
be back at the village Friday. I&rsquo;ve got to get
word to the mystery man what day they&rsquo;re starting
for the border.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The woman promised me to save some of the
pottery for me, but I want to select the best designs
from the entire lot before she sells any of
them,&rdquo; Florence put in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means we&rsquo;ll have to go and get the pottery
before those men come,&rdquo; Jo Ann remarked.
&ldquo;That suits me to a T. You&rsquo;ve already written
to your friend in St. Louis that you&rsquo;re sending
the pottery in a few days, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that settles it. We&rsquo;ll go to the village to
get the pottery Thursday morning and take it
to the city and ship it from there. That&rsquo;ll give
me a fine chance to find out from the woman
when the smugglers&rsquo;re coming and to see the
mystery man and tell him when to look out for
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see where you&rsquo;re headed for more trouble,&rdquo;
Peggy spoke up. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better keep your fingers
out of this whole affair. You&rsquo;re too adventuresome.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>Jo Ann half smiled. &ldquo;Oh, skip it&mdash;the lecture,
I mean. Let&rsquo;s get the horses and go for a ride
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;d like better than to go
for a long ride, and that&rsquo;s to go through the
mine,&rdquo; Florence said. &ldquo;Mr. Eldridge promised
me he&rsquo;d take us through it while I&rsquo;m here this
time. When he comes in to lunch, let&rsquo;s beg him
to take us down into it this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; approved Jo Ann. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been eager to
see how the <i>malacate</i> works now that it&rsquo;s run by
electricity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a <i>malacate</i>, and what does it do?&rdquo;
Peggy asked curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a windlass arrangement that draws the
ore up out of the mine. A rawhide bag is tied to
the end of a long cable and let down into the
shaft. Using electricity is a vast improvement
over the old way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the peons have to work the windlass&mdash;wind
it by hand?&rdquo; Peggy asked, puzzled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, burros were used for that purpose. But
before they used a windlass, back in primitive
times, they made the Indians carry the ore up in
bags, and they had to climb all the way up out
of the mine on dangerous notched logs for ladders.
Many and many of those Indians have
fallen into the deep shafts, to their death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was silence for a moment; then Florence
spoke up: &ldquo;I have my doubts if Mr.
Eldridge&rsquo;ll take us into the mine in the daytime.
The miners are very superstitious about
women going into the mine, he said. They think
every time a woman goes in, something terrible
always happens&mdash;an awful explosion or a cave-in,
killing one or more of the miners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann nodded understandingly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so.
I&rsquo;d forgotten about that. We&rsquo;ll ask him to take us
tonight, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as Mr. Eldridge came in to lunch, all
three girls greeted him with requests to show
them through the mine that night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We-ell, I don&rsquo;t know quite what to say to
that,&rdquo; he replied slowly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ve been two peculiar
accidents lately that make me somewhat
reluctant to take you down into the mine. Those
accidents haven&rsquo;t been accounted for to my satisfaction
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they were both outside the mine, weren&rsquo;t
they?&rdquo; asked Jo Ann.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And two days have passed by without any
more trouble,&rdquo; Florence added.</p>
<p>Mr. Eldridge smiled. &ldquo;Well, I might as well
say you may go. When three girls pounce upon
one poor defenseless man, he has to agree to their
plans. There&rsquo;s no night shift working tonight,
so this&rsquo;ll be a good time. Be ready by eight
o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; the girls chorused in reply.</p>
<p>That afternoon the three, accompanied by
Carlitos and Miss Prudence, took a long horseback
ride over a beautiful mountain trail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>Miss Prudence refused, however, to go with
them on their trip to inspect the mine that night
or to let Carlitos go. &ldquo;Carlitos is tired and sleepy
from the long ride, and bed&rsquo;s the best place
for him,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I should think you girls
would&rsquo;ve had enough exercise, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By a quarter of eight the girls were ready and
waiting. Knowing that the mine was damp and
cold, they had put on their sweaters and heaviest
oxfords, and Jo Ann and Peggy had prepared
themselves for darkness as well, as they had their
flashlights.</p>
<p>When Mr. Eldridge and they reached the
shaft, he switched on the electricity to work the
<i>malacate</i> so they could go down into the mine.</p>
<p>No sooner had the machinery started running
than the Mexican night watchman came running
to investigate, an alarmed expression on his face.
&ldquo;Ah, it is you!&rdquo; he exclaimed in a relieved tone
on seeing Mr. Eldridge.</p>
<p>Mr. Eldridge smiled. &ldquo;You are a good watchman,
Manuel. I am taking the se&ntilde;oritas down to
show them how we mine the ore. Do not tell anyone
the se&ntilde;oritas have been in the mine. <i>Sabe?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>S&iacute;.</i> I <i>sabe</i>,&rdquo; Manuel replied quickly, knowing
at once why <i>El Se&ntilde;or</i> had given this order.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t turn off the <i>malacate</i>. See that nobody
comes near it. Stay close by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Manuel nodded assent. &ldquo;I stay here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Manuel is the best watchman we&rsquo;ve ever
had,&rdquo; Mr. Eldridge told the girls. &ldquo;I can trust
him not to go to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Jo Ann found herself in the rawhide
bag tied at the end of the long cable and being
dropped down into the shaft&rsquo;s eerie darkness, she
felt a queer sinking sensation at the pit of her
stomach, as if she were falling through bottomless
space. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s breath-taking&mdash;scary,&rdquo; she
thought.</p>
<p>It was with a gasp of relief that she stepped
out of the bag and onto the rocky bottom of the
shaft. She knew exactly how Peggy felt when she
scrambled out of the bag a little later and exclaimed,
&ldquo;Wh-ew! My heart&rsquo;s up here!&rdquo; She
was clutching her throat dramatically.</p>
<p>Together they waited for Florence&rsquo;s descent.
By their flashlights&rsquo; gleam they could see that
her eyes were dilated and her lips tightly closed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It scared you speechless,&rdquo; grinned Peggy
after waiting a moment for her to speak.</p>
<p>Florence nodded and managed a &ldquo;Took my
breath!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed to all three that of all the cold,
damp, terrifying places to work, a silver mine
was the worst. Mr. Eldridge led them through
low narrow tunnels and into several black, cavernous
recesses opening from these passageways
and showed them the different mining
processes.</p>
<p>Peggy became decidedly nervous on learning
that the ore was dynamited down. &ldquo;There might
be some dynamite around here now, and it might
explode and blow us into smithereens,&rdquo; she whispered
to Jo Ann.</p>
<p>A few minutes later she bumped into something
against the wall that made her leap back in
haste. When Mr. Eldridge told her it was a
dynamite box, her heart began leaping faster
than ever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He means an empty dynamite box,&rdquo; Jo Ann
explained hastily as her flashlight&rsquo;s beam
showed her the ghastly pallor of Peggy&rsquo;s face.
&ldquo;Some miners are using it as an altar,&rdquo; she added
comfortingly. &ldquo;See, there&rsquo;s a picture of the Virgin
inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;m ready to leave this murky
gloom and get back up into the good fresh air,&rdquo;
Peggy said, her voice still shaky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I believe you&rsquo;ve seen all the most interesting
things.&rdquo; Mr. Eldridge smiled. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
go on up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they came back to the shaft, to Mr.
Eldridge&rsquo;s amazement, the <i>malacate</i> was not
working. &ldquo;Now what&rsquo;s the matter!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
annoyed. &ldquo;I told Manuel to keep the
<i>malacate</i> running so we could get back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For several minutes they stood waiting in vain
for the cable and bag to appear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>Finally, in an exasperated tone Mr. Eldridge
remarked, &ldquo;Never had anything like this happen
before. Can&rsquo;t imagine what&rsquo;s the matter.
Manuel&rsquo;s always been so dependable. We may
have to walk all that long distance to the entrance
of the workings. And you&rsquo;re all so tired
already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then there sounded an excited cry that
reverberated uncannily through the shaft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s Jos&eacute;&rsquo;s voice!&rdquo; Jo Ann exclaimed.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next instant the words, &ldquo;Manuel&rsquo;s&mdash;killed!&rdquo;
echoed down to them.</p>
<p>A moment&rsquo;s stunned silence fell; then Mr.
Eldridge gasped, &ldquo;Manuel&mdash;killed! Start the
<i>malacate</i> at once, so we can get up there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No can&mdash;the wires all broke,&rdquo; came back the
wailing answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wires broken&mdash;and Manuel killed and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
Mr. Eldridge&rsquo;s voice trailed off into silence.</p>
<p>Jo Ann cut in, &ldquo;Jos&eacute;&rsquo;s so excitable! Manuel
may have only fainted or been shocked unconscious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. All the more reason I must get
up there at once. It&rsquo;ll take us so long to walk to
the entrance.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t Jos&eacute; attach burros to the <i>malacate</i> and
pull us up that way?&rdquo; put in Jo Ann.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he could. That&rsquo;d take lots less time.&rdquo;
Mr. Eldridge called immediately to Jos&eacute; to attach
the burros to the <i>malacate</i> and start it working,
ending with the usual, &ldquo;<i>Sabe?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>S&iacute;</i>,&rdquo; Jos&eacute; called back. &ldquo;I go now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While they were anxiously awaiting for Jos&eacute;
to start the <i>malacate</i>, Mr. Eldridge remarked
that he had better go up first to see about Manuel.
&ldquo;I hate to go ahead of you, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about us,&rdquo; Jo Ann said, more
confidently than she felt. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing here
to harm us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all,&rdquo; agreed Florence in a voice
that quivered unconvincingly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>Just then Peggy&rsquo;s hand clutched Jo Ann&rsquo;s convulsively.
&ldquo;Poor Peg&rsquo;s scared stiff at the idea of
his leaving us,&rdquo; thought Jo Ann as she grasped
the cold hand in a comforting pressure. Her
mind, however, flew back to Manuel. Surely he
couldn&rsquo;t have been killed. He must&rsquo;ve fainted.
But he was so strong-looking. What could have
happened in that short time? If only Jos&eacute; would
hurry faster and let down that cable. &ldquo;Oh, surely
Manuel can&rsquo;t be dead!&rdquo; she kept repeating to
herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII
<br /><span class="small">IN THE DARKNESS</span></h2>
<p>After what seemed to Jo Ann an interminable
time the cable appeared, and Mr. Eldridge
was pulled up the shaft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel better now that he&rsquo;s up safely,&rdquo; Jo Ann
said, breathing more freely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know which I dread worse&mdash;going
up in that awful bag or staying down here in
this terrible dark,&rdquo; Peggy groaned.</p>
<p>Noticing that Peggy&rsquo;s flashlight was not on,
Florence asked, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you switch on your
flashlight? That&rsquo;ll help some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t turn on. When I bumped against
that dynamite box, I got so scared I dropped it.
It must&rsquo;ve got broken then.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>So worried over Manuel was Jo Ann that she
paid little heed to Peggy&rsquo;s continued laments. If
only this awful suspense about him was over!
Surely he must be only unconscious. If he were,
when they got out they could help give him first
aid. She&rsquo;d had first-aid training in her scout
work. &ldquo;I wish I could go up first and see if I
could do anything for him,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<p>Just then she heard Peggy say, &ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;ll
go up first. I can&rsquo;t stand this creepy darkness. I
keep thinking that smuggler&rsquo;s hidden down here
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peggy&rsquo;s so upset and nervous, she&rsquo;d better go
up first,&rdquo; Jo Ann admitted to herself reluctantly.
Aloud she said, &ldquo;All right, Peg, you go next.
See what you can do to help Manuel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Jo, Manuel&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo; she wailed.</p>
<p>Jo Ann shook her head as she answered, &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t believe that he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shuddering, Peggy went on: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d planned to
wait for you two before I took a step when I got
up. The lights are off up there. Whoever killed
Manuel must&rsquo;ve cut off the lights.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Eldridge&rsquo;ll have some kind of a light,
surely. If Manuel&rsquo;s breathing&mdash;I can&rsquo;t help feeling
that he is&mdash;do everything you can for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon the quivering Peggy was inside the bag
and being slowly pulled up the shaft. When,
however, she had ascended only a short way,
something went wrong with the cable, and the
bag hung suspended&mdash;motionless.</p>
<p>Peggy&rsquo;s terrified shriek echoed and re-echoed
through the shaft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horrors!&rdquo; gasped Florence. &ldquo;I hope the
cable&rsquo;s not stuck. Sometimes it&rsquo;ll get stuck that
way for an hour or more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be all right in a minute,&rdquo; Jo Ann
called up to Peggy. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get scared.&rdquo; In a low
voice she added to Florence, &ldquo;I hope I&rsquo;m telling
the whole truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To their vast relief, in a few minutes the bag
began to move upward once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness!&rdquo; Florence ejaculated.
&ldquo;Which one of us had better go up next? I&rsquo;d like
to, but if you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>Jo Ann&rsquo;s impulse was to speak up, &ldquo;Let me
go,&rdquo; but, instead, she replied, &ldquo;You go on. I have
a flashlight, and you haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several minutes later, with mingled feelings
of relief and fear, she watched Florence being
pulled up till she was above the reach of the
flashlight&rsquo;s beam. All was eerie blackness now.
The shadows began to take on weird ghostlike
shapes. Was that a man crouching over there?
The smuggler?</p>
<p>An involuntary shudder shivered through her
body. She must not let her imagination run riot
this way. She steadied her lower lip to prevent
its trembling.</p>
<p>At last the bag loomed into view, and after an
anxious wait she got inside it. Slowly&mdash;painfully
slowly she began to ascend.</p>
<p>When she was about halfway up, the cable
suddenly spun around, knocking the bag against
the rocky side of the shaft. She felt a stinging
sensation in her right arm as it struck the rocks.
Clutching her flashlight more tightly and cringing
with pain, she lifted her arm to protect her
light. It was too late. The flashlight had been
broken&mdash;badly smashed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>In another moment she had forgotten about
her injured arm and broken flashlight in a more
serious trouble. The bag was stuck&mdash;not moving
either up or down. She stifled a shriek that was
threatening to escape her lips. No wonder Peggy
had cried out. And it was worse this time. There
was utter darkness below. No one to call up comfortingly
from the bottom of the shaft. No one
at the top either. Both girls were probably hovering
over Manuel now, if he&mdash;&mdash; Had they
found by now that he really was dead?</p>
<p>She must shut out that terrifying picture from
her mind. It seemed, though, to be outlined
against the darkness in a glaring light that refused
to be blotted out. How long would she have
to hang this way in midair, seeing this horrible
picture?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Better to hang suspended than to be dashed
to the bottom on those rocks,&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;Peg was in the same plight, and now she&rsquo;s up
safely. But then she was stuck only two or three
minutes, and you&rsquo;ve been here ten or fifteen at
least,&rdquo; she reminded herself discouragedly.</p>
<p>Endless ages dragged on, it seemed to her, as
she hung there. Would this suspense never end?
Had anything happened to Jos&eacute;? Had he been
killed, too?</p>
<p>At last, when her hopes had almost ebbed
away, she felt the bag moving upward. Actually
going up now. As she neared the top and drew in
deep breaths of the fresh air, a great wave of
gratitude swept over her.</p>
<p>Once safely out on the ground, she began feeling
her way through the darkness toward the
light on her left. Jos&eacute; hurried up just then with
a lantern in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about Manuel&mdash;he is not dead, is
he?&rdquo; she asked him quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he is. He look dead when I see him,&rdquo;
Jos&eacute; answered brokenly. &ldquo;That wicked Luis&mdash;he
knock him down. I catch Luis and tie him to
a tree.&rdquo; He gestured to the right.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Luis! That miner Mr. Eldridge discharged
for stealing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why did he want to hurt Manuel? Manuel
didn&rsquo;t discharge him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Manuel tell him to keep away.&rdquo; Jos&eacute; went on
to explain that Luis had thrown a crowbar back
of the switchboard, so the <i>malacate</i> would not
work, and that when Manuel had tried to grab
him Luis had knocked him down. There was a
triumphant tone in his voice as he added, &ldquo;I
catch Luis. I fix him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did it happen that you came up here?
You didn&rsquo;t come with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&eacute; hesitated a moment, then replied, &ldquo;I saw
you come up here, and I think <i>El Se&ntilde;or</i> need
me. He tell me to take Luis down to the big
house now. I leave you now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On nearing the <i>malacate</i> Jo Ann could see
Manuel&rsquo;s inert figure lying on the ground, Mr.
Eldridge bending over him, and the girls standing
near by.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is he&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Jo Ann left her question unfinished,
but both girls knew what she meant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s still alive,&rdquo; Florence whispered. &ldquo;Unconscious.
I could feel his pulse. His skin is a
clammy cold. I wish I had some hot-water bottles
to put around him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness he&rsquo;s still alive!&rdquo; Jo Ann exclaimed
softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve put our sweaters over him,&rdquo; Peggy
added, gesturing to the sweaters on Manuel&rsquo;s
body. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think of anything else to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might heat some rocks or bricks and put
around him,&rdquo; Jo Ann suggested eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; approved Mr. Eldridge, who
had overheard her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you. We must do
something to help him, since it&rsquo;ll be hours before
we can get a doctor here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They hurried about gathering wood and soon
built a small fire on some flat stones. As soon as
the stones were hot, they pushed them out of the
fire, then covered them with some old pieces of a
torn blanket.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We must be absolutely certain these rocks&rsquo;ll
not burn him,&rdquo; Jo Ann cautioned. &ldquo;Persons suffering
from shock are more easily burned than
usual. My scout book said never to put anything
hot next the patient till it could be held against
your face for a minute without feeling too hot.&rdquo;
She tested each stone before passing it on to
Mr. Eldridge to place next to the unconscious
figure.</p>
<p>After that was done, Jo Ann began rubbing
his arms toward the body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;s she doing that?&rdquo; queried Peggy in a
low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s to restore the circulation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Jo Ann was still rubbing his arms,
Manuel&rsquo;s eyelids began to flicker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s beginning to become conscious,&rdquo; Mr.
Eldridge said, low-voiced. &ldquo;As soon as Jos&eacute;
comes back he and I&rsquo;ll carry him down to the
house. There isn&rsquo;t any serious bleeding, so I feel
sure it&rsquo;ll be safe to carry him now. We&rsquo;ll have
to make a stretcher.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>No sooner had he finished speaking than Jo
Ann dashed away, returning shortly with two
poles. Mr. Eldridge immediately jerked off his
coat and pulled the poles through the sleeves,
then tied a piece of blanket securely to the poles
also. By that time Jos&eacute; was back from taking
Luis to the house. With Mr. Eldridge&rsquo;s help
Jos&eacute; tenderly lifted the injured man upon the improvised
stretcher and set off down the trail,
careful to hold the poles as steady as possible.</p>
<p>The girls followed close behind, Jo Ann
bringing up the rear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know where Jos&eacute; took the prisoner?&rdquo;
Peggy asked Jo Ann.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. To our house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious! That&rsquo;s awful. I&rsquo;ll never be able to
sleep a wink tonight, knowing he&rsquo;s in the same
house that we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the safest place to keep him in the camp.
The walls are as thick as a regular prison&rsquo;s, and
there&rsquo;re iron bars to all the windows. Besides,
Jos&eacute;&rsquo;ll guard him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It makes me shivery all over to know he&rsquo;s
under our roof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe even a Houdini could escape
from that house,&rdquo; Jo Ann assured her. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
be safe. Don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><span class="small">JO ANN FINDS A WAY</span></h2>
<p>Although Peggy had vowed she would never
be able to close her eyes all night with that prisoner
in the house, she was so tired that she was
not long in dropping off to sleep. Exhausted by
their exciting experiences, all three slept till late
the next morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a welcome change,&rdquo; as Florence expressed
it afterwards, Miss Prudence had not
wanted to get an early start to go somewhere or
to do some housework, and so had allowed them
to drowse on undisturbed.</p>
<p>The first thing Jo Ann saw on waking was the
smiling Maria carrying in a tray of food.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>As Maria set the tray on the small table between
the beds, she remarked, &ldquo;Miss Prudencia
say you may have your breakfast in bed. You
were so brave&mdash;so good to help Manuel last
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Muchas gracias</i>,&rdquo; replied Jo Ann, eying delightedly
the golden toast, oranges, crisp brown
bacon, and cups of steaming chocolate.</p>
<p>Peggy and Florence chimed in with their
thanks; then Peggy put in quickly, &ldquo;Florence,
ask her if the prisoner is still in the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence promptly relayed this question.</p>
<p>Maria nodded. &ldquo;<i>S&iacute;.</i> Jos&eacute; watch good all
night.&rdquo; She went on to add that Jos&eacute; had just
come into the kitchen and had said he wanted to
tell the se&ntilde;oritas something about Luis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know what it is?&rdquo; Florence asked
curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Miss Prudencia send me out of the
kitchen then, and Jos&eacute; leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Jos&eacute; going to the village to get the <i>rurales</i>
to come after Luis this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>S&iacute;.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him when he comes back that we want
to go with him. Tell him to have the horses ready
for us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>With a nod of assent Maria left the room.</p>
<p>Jo Ann began eating an orange, a thoughtful
expression in her dark brown eyes. A moment
later she remarked, &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if that
Luis was hired by the smuggler to do all the
damage he could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what makes you think that?&rdquo; asked
Peggy in surprise. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t seen them together,
have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve never seen that smuggler here
again since that first time, have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why this sudden idea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because two men in the same small mining
camp who have a grievance against the mine
owners would be likely to get together. They&rsquo;d
have a common interest&mdash;to get even.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy smiled. &ldquo;Oh, you Miss Sherlock!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your mentioning the smuggler reminds me
that the pottery woman said she&rsquo;d have the pottery
ready for us today,&rdquo; put in Florence. &ldquo;I
want you girls to help me select the finest pieces
as samples to send to my friend in St. Louis for
her curio shop. It&rsquo;ll be quite a job to get them
packed right. I was in hopes Jos&eacute; would have
time to help me pack them. His having to get
the officers this morning might interfere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it will,&rdquo; Jo Ann replied. &ldquo;Do
you think you could get a crate in the village and
pack your pottery there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it. They&rsquo;ve never shipped any pottery
by train. I believe I&rsquo;ll take the pottery to
Jitters&rsquo; House, and Jos&eacute; can hunt up something
around there to make a crate out of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time the girls had finished eating and
had dressed in riding outfits, Jos&eacute; was waiting
for them with the horses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>As soon as they came out, Florence asked Jos&eacute;
what it was that he had to tell them about the
prisoner, Luis. After he had explained in a rapid
flow of Spanish, Florence passed the news to the
eager Jo Ann and Peggy. &ldquo;He said Luis had
told him that some strange man had promised to
give him a few <i>pesos</i> if he would wreck the mine
machinery. He believes, judging by Luis&rsquo;s description,
that this stranger was one of the men
the pottery woman warned us about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I guessed right,&rdquo; Jo Ann spoke up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem fair for Luis to get a prison
sentence and for the smuggler to go free,&rdquo; Peggy
said, low-voiced, to Jo Ann.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both of those smugglers&rsquo;re going to get
caught yet&mdash;you&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo; Jo Ann&rsquo;s head bobbed
up and down emphatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does that mean you&rsquo;re going to try to catch
them?&rdquo; Peggy asked, an anxious note in her
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait and see,&rdquo; Jo Ann replied teasingly as
she leaped on her horse.</p>
<p>On reaching the village Jos&eacute; went in search of
the officers while the girls drove to the pottery
woman&rsquo;s shack to buy the <i>ollas</i> and vases.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>With the greatest care Florence, with the girls&rsquo;
help, selected the most artistic designs and
shapes from the piles of pottery. &ldquo;If my friend
likes these pieces as well&rsquo;s I do,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I
know she&rsquo;ll buy regularly from these villagers
and take a large per cent of their output. They&rsquo;ll
get ever so much more money, too, than they have
been getting. We&rsquo;ll be doing them a good turn,
as well as my friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Jo Ann&rsquo;s urging Florence then began
adroitly questioning the woman about when she
was expecting the men to come after the pottery
this week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They send me word they come in two days,&rdquo;
she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be Friday, then,&rdquo; commented Jo Ann,
who had caught the woman&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>After they had finished choosing the pieces of
pottery, they packed them in the back of the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know where Jos&eacute;&rsquo;s going to sit
now,&rdquo; observed Peggy as she crowded into the
front seat with Jo Ann and Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll manage someway,&rdquo; Jo Ann smiled.</p>
<p>On reaching Pedro&rsquo;s store they found Jos&eacute;
waiting for them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did you find the <i>rurales</i>?&rdquo; Florence asked
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>S&iacute;</i>, I find two. They have gone to the mine to
get Luis. They say they do not need me to help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Florence approved. &ldquo;Now you can
help me pack these <i>ollas</i> and vases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Jos&eacute; had squeezed into the back seat and
they were driving off, Peggy remarked to Florence,
&ldquo;What puzzles me is how are you going to
get the pottery shipped after you get it packed?
There&rsquo;s no railroad and no truck service here.
Someone&rsquo;ll have to take it to the city. How&rsquo;re
you going to get it to the city?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought we&rsquo;d drive in ourselves if&mdash;if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t let there be any ifs about it,&rdquo; broke
in Jo Ann crisply. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get to the city
tomorrow. I&rsquo;ve got to get word to the mystery
man to be on the lookout for the smugglers Friday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you write to him?&rdquo; Peggy asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t reach him in time. They take the
mail in to the city every other day. I asked at the
store, and the mail&rsquo;s already been sent, and no
more&rsquo;ll be sent till Friday. That&rsquo;d be too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Miss Prudence&rsquo;ll probably say &lsquo;nothing
doing&rsquo; when we tell her we want to drive to
the city,&rdquo; persisted Peggy. &ldquo;She said she didn&rsquo;t
like riding in Jitters well enough to take another
trip to the city soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard her say yesterday that she had to
have some more supplies&mdash;that she just couldn&rsquo;t
keep house without a larger variety of food,&rdquo;
Florence remarked. &ldquo;She said we&rsquo;d all be having
scurvy and beri-beri and all sorts of diseases if
we didn&rsquo;t have a greater variety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann smiled. &ldquo;That sounds good to me&mdash;not
the diseases, of course. We&rsquo;ll tell her we&rsquo;ll bring
her a load of good eats&mdash;fresh fruits and vegetables
and anything she asks for. I&rsquo;m going to
get word to the mystery man&mdash;or bust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both girls laughed, and Peggy added a moment
later, &ldquo;Puff out your cheeks and prepare
to bust, Jo, &rsquo;cause Miss Prudence won&rsquo;t let you
go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You underrate my persuasive powers, and
you don&rsquo;t realize how tired she is of preparing
the same menus, day after day. I heard her say
the other day that about the only thing Pedro
sold at his store was beans, beans, beans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they reached Jitters&rsquo; House, Jos&eacute; set to
work at once to make a crate. The girls wrapped
each piece of pottery with the paper they had
brought for that purpose and carefully placed
the smaller jars inside the larger ones. When the
crate was finished, they packed excelsior around
the jars and in every inch of space. That done,
Jos&eacute; carried the crate over to the house across
the road, for safe-keeping.</p>
<p>With a wide smile Jo Ann remarked, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
have to get an early start tomorrow morning to
take our crate to the city. We&rsquo;ll have to promise
to make the trip there and back in one day, I
know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>When they were riding horseback on the
mountain trail, they met the <i>rurales</i> taking their
prisoner to the village. The girls urged their
horses close to the cliff to allow room for them
to pass on the narrow trail.</p>
<p>After they had gone by, Jo Ann said gravely,
&ldquo;I hope it won&rsquo;t be long till the smugglers are
prison-bound, too. I believe this Luis was just
their tool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as they had entered the house, the
girls hunted up Miss Prudence, and Jo Ann told
of their plan to take the pottery to the city the
next day and get supplies for her.</p>
<p>Miss Prudence pursed up her lips thoughtfully
and remained silent for some time before
answering.</p>
<p>Jo Ann, with her usual impatience, could not
stand this quiet and suspense and began talking
about the necessity of a more varied diet. &ldquo;We
need more fruit and vegetables to have a balanced
diet, don&rsquo;t you think? Our home economics
teacher told us at school that it was absolutely
necessary for us to get plenty of fruit, as
most of it has vitamin B. It&rsquo;s that vitamin that
makes our nerves normal and steady, she said.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>Miss Prudence&rsquo;s lips relaxed into a whimsical
smile. &ldquo;Well, we certainly need our nerves steadied
after last night&rsquo;s wild excitement.&rdquo; She
grew grave again. &ldquo;I believe that Luis was trying
to kill Ed and you girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann did not stop to argue this point but
kept to the diet question. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll make a list
of the things you want, we&rsquo;ll have them here for
you tomorrow evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before dark?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hesitate to give my consent. Maybe
I&rsquo;d better go with you&mdash;but, no. I feel as if I
ought to stay and nurse Manuel. Maria has no
more idea than a jay bird about how to take care
of sick folks. Why, when I put some rolls of
bandage in the hot oven to sterilize this morning,
she looked at me as if she thought I was crazy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of her hesitation, Jo Ann finally succeeded
in persuading her to let them go to the
city.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you set the alarm clock for four-thirty and
get up then, I believe you can make the trip in
one day,&rdquo; she said as the girls were about to
leave. &ldquo;Take my clock to your room.&rdquo; She
reached over to the near-by table, picked up her
alarm clock, and set it to go off at that hour before
handing it to Jo Ann.</p>
<p>It was hard for Jo Ann to keep from laughing,
as she could see Florence&rsquo;s eyes twinkling,
and Peggy holding her hand over her mouth to
check her mirth.</p>
<p>At the first sound of the alarm the next morning,
Jo Ann reached over and turned it off, then
popped out of bed and began dressing. Florence
rose almost as promptly, but it required much
persuasion from both of them to get Peggy out
of bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not keen on this trip anyway, since we
won&rsquo;t get to stay in the city tonight and promenade
on the Plaza,&rdquo; she grumbled drowsily as
she sat on the edge of the bed, making no move
to dress. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not interested in seeing an old
mystery man, as Jo Ann is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Only in handsome young Mexican ones,&rdquo; Jo
Ann grinned. &ldquo;Well, you may pass your smiling
young Mexican on the street today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I should, I&rsquo;d look very romantic sitting in
an old car packed with a huge crate, now,
wouldn&rsquo;t I? He&rsquo;d think I was bringing chickens
or something to market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both girls laughed at Peggy&rsquo;s disgusted tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That reminds me,&rdquo; Jo Ann added, &ldquo;that we
must go straight to the market as soon as we reach
the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time they had dressed and had eaten a
hurried breakfast, Jos&eacute; was waiting for them
with the horses. To their surprise he rode on up
the trail with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were going with us,&rdquo; Florence
remarked to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Prudencia say I must take you to the
village and go back for you this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. It might be late this evening
before we get back, but we&rsquo;re counting on getting
back before dark.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>As soon as they reached Jitters&rsquo; House, they
changed their clothes while Jos&eacute; was putting the
pottery crate into their car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jitters is a picture now,&rdquo; Peggy remarked on
coming out to the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be sure to see your handsome young
man today,&rdquo; teased Jo Ann.</p>
<p>So interested were the girls in their plans for
the day, as they drove through the village, that
Jo Ann for once forgot to look over at the pottery
woman&rsquo;s shack till after she had reached
Pedro&rsquo;s store. &ldquo;Did either of you notice if the
pottery was still piled up by the woman&rsquo;s
house?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Both shook their heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it must be still there. The woman
seemed to be certain that the men weren&rsquo;t coming
till tomorrow to get it. She said they&rsquo;d sent
her word this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As there was little travel on the road, Jo Ann
was able to make good time. As usual, she had
planned to let Florence drive when they neared
the city.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>&ldquo;At the rate you&rsquo;re speeding, Jo,&rdquo; Florence
remarked finally, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll be in town before we
realize it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann laughed. &ldquo;Speeding in Jitters? Impossible.
That old car in front of us isn&rsquo;t built for
speeding, either. It&rsquo;s been keeping ahead at
about the same distance for the last hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve noticed,&rdquo; said Peggy. &ldquo;It must be of
the same year&rsquo;s vintage as Jitters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she is, Jitters can beat her. I&rsquo;m going to
step on it and see if I can&rsquo;t gain on her.&rdquo; With
that Jo Ann stepped on the gas, and soon their
car was lessening the distance between it and
the car ahead.</p>
<p>As they drew closer Jo Ann suddenly uttered
an excited little cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; queried Florence and
Peggy together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the smugglers&rsquo; car!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re crazy, Jo!&rdquo; ejaculated Peggy derisively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be!&rdquo; Florence cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is! I&rsquo;m positive it is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just guessing,&rdquo; retorted Peggy. &ldquo;You
can&rsquo;t tell from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to pass that car, and you look
hard, Florence, and see if those men aren&rsquo;t the
smugglers and if it isn&rsquo;t piled full of pottery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t, Jo,&rdquo; begged Peggy, now beginning
to be afraid that Jo Ann might be right. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
try to pass it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX
<br /><span class="small">AN EXCITING RACE</span></h2>
<p>With a warning honk of her horn Jo Ann
sped up and started to pass the other car.</p>
<p>Almost simultaneously one of the men turned
and stared incredulously, then shouted out a
sharp order. The next instant the other man
swerved his car dangerously toward them, trying
to force them off into a deep ditch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, step on it!&rdquo; cried Peggy. &ldquo;Step on it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re trying to hit us!&rdquo; shrieked Florence.</p>
<p>Somewhere from the back of Jo Ann&rsquo;s mind
came the command, &ldquo;Keep your head!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Automatically her nerves and muscles obeyed.
She turned her car sharply and swiftly out
toward the ditch as close as she dared, giving it
all the gas that it would take.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>For a perilous moment that seemed ages-long
to the girls the car hovered near the edge of the
bank. Instinctively both Florence and Peggy
leaned to the other side of the car, as if to make
their weight the deciding factor in keeping the
car from falling into the ditch.</p>
<p>Then, to their unbounded relief, their car
swept by, missing the other by a few inches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A miracle!&rdquo; gasped Peggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep stepping on it!&rdquo; implored Peggy as she
turned to look back at the smugglers&rsquo; car.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming full tilt after us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O-oh, hear them yelling at us!&rdquo; put in Florence,
her eyes dilated with fright. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re trying
to catch us. Step on it! Suppose they should
shoot at us&mdash;or our tires!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>Though Jo Ann heard the girls&rsquo; earnest pleas,
she wasted no energy in replying. Every cell in
her brain must be centered on driving. That car
was still dangerously near. They might push past
and try that same trick of forcing her into the
ditch on the other side. Moreover, the road
ahead was much steeper and narrower. It wound
threadlike up the mountain side. What if those
smugglers should deliberately wait and force
them off that high road! To be knocked off that
steep rocky cliff would mean death for all of
them. And what if her engine should go bad up
there&mdash;or a tire blow out! &ldquo;Steady, Jo,&rdquo; she
ordered herself. &ldquo;Stop worrying and concentrate
on driving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not gaining an inch,&rdquo; Florence called
out encouragingly then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they&rsquo;re not losing any,&rdquo; added Peggy.</p>
<p>When, in spite of her determination not to
worry, she had to slow down at turns in the winding
road, she found her breath coming more and
more quickly. Perhaps the smugglers could
make the turns faster.</p>
<p>Again and again Florence encouraged her
with, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not gaining.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, when they were nearing the highest
stretch of all, Florence exclaimed, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
dropping behind a little now! See, Peg!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hot ziggity! They are, sure enough!&rdquo; cried
Peggy, vastly relieved. &ldquo;I believe the worst&rsquo;s
over. But don&rsquo;t slow down, Jo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t any more than I have to,&rdquo; Jo Ann replied,
cheered immensely by the girls&rsquo; assurance
that the smugglers were dropping behind in the
race.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good old Jo&mdash;and good old Jitters,&rdquo; praised
Florence. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t be beaten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t brag too soon,&rdquo; Jo Ann found time to
say in short, clipped sentences.</p>
<p>She was determined to keep Jitters running at
the greatest speed possible, and yet not be reckless
in making the many sharp curves. With
mind and eyes ever alert, she watched the road.
She must be ready for any emergency.</p>
<p>Florence and Peggy kept turning every minute
or two to watch the pursuing car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s losing ground right along,&rdquo; Peggy kept
saying, ending each time with, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it, Florence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each time, to Jo Ann&rsquo;s joy, Florence would
reply with an emphatic &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>Still Jo Ann held to the maximum speed possible
for safety. &ldquo;Nothing like being on the safe
side,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;They might gain on us
on the down grade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After they were on the downward stretch, both
girls assured her that they believed the danger
was over. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll never catch us now unless we
have engine or tire trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later, on glancing back,
Peggy exclaimed triumphantly, &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve about
stopped! They&rsquo;ve stopped now! On that highest
curve. One of them&rsquo;s getting out now. Maybe
they have a flat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s hoping they have two flats,&rdquo; smiled
Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not wish for three, for good measure?&rdquo;
added Jo Ann.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, aren&rsquo;t you thankful Miss Prudence isn&rsquo;t
along?&rdquo; Peggy asked suddenly.</p>
<p>Both girls smiled, and Peggy went on, &ldquo;She&rsquo;d
have had heart failure or something by this
time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, she wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; declared Jo Ann. &ldquo;She&rsquo;d
have rallied to the cause and encouraged me on,
as you two did. When it comes to the test, she&rsquo;s
strong for action and plenty of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later Florence announced that
it would not be long till they would reach the
city. &ldquo;Do you think we&rsquo;d better change, Jo, and
let me take the wheel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann shook her head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to stop
even long enough for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, don&rsquo;t change,&rdquo; begged Peggy, immediately
disturbed at the idea of stopping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the shortest way to the market now,
and that&rsquo;s where we want to go first,&rdquo; Jo Ann declared.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to find the mystery man at once,
so he can get on the smugglers&rsquo; trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be easy for him to follow them even
then,&rdquo; Peggy said thoughtfully. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t they go
around the city some way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s the only road till they get to the
edge of the city,&rdquo; replied Florence. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll
probably not come up into the main part.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I imagine the mystery man&rsquo;ll phone or telegraph
to the officers on both sides of the border
to be on the lookout,&rdquo; put in Jo Ann. &ldquo;They
could catch more of the gang that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Jo Ann turned into the street leading to
the market, Florence remarked, &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be no use
trying to find a parking place in front of the
market. It&rsquo;s always full. You&rsquo;ll save time by
parking in the first empty place you find within
a reasonable distance. I&rsquo;ve wasted as much as
half an hour hunting for a parking place down
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t waste any time anyway,&rdquo; Peggy
put in. &ldquo;We have lots of things to buy for Miss
Prudence, and I&rsquo;ve a little shopping I want to
do, too. We can be doing our buying while Jo
hunts up her mystery man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At quite a little distance from the market Jo
Ann found a parking place. No sooner had she
stopped the car than she sprang out, saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
meet you at that same booth in front, where we
waited the other day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>Off she rushed down the street, her fast-flying
steps causing more than one Mexican to say
smilingly, &ldquo;<i>Americana</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Peggy tried to lock the car a few moments
later, she found that she couldn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s
gone wrong with it,&rdquo; she said, handing
the key to Florence. &ldquo;See if you can make it
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After several unsuccessful efforts Florence
slipped the keys into her purse, saying, &ldquo;Oh,
let&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t worry any more about trying to lock
it. We can get a boy to watch the car for us.&rdquo;
Hardly had she finished speaking than she
caught a glimpse of the newsboy with whom
Carlitos had been so friendly. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the very
boy!&rdquo; she exclaimed, gesturing to him to come
to her.</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s large black eyes lit in swift recognition,
and he ran over to her side.</p>
<p>Florence quickly explained to him that she
wanted him to watch the car while she went to
the market.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>With a nod of assent the boy answered, smiling,
&ldquo;<i>S&iacute;.</i> I watch good for you. You are Carlitos&rsquo;s
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll watch it right; we won&rsquo;t have to
worry,&rdquo; Florence said confidently as she and
Peggy walked on down to the market.</p>
<p>Soon they were busily buying fruit and vegetables.</p>
<p>In the meantime Jo Ann had elbowed her way
through the crowded aisles of the market to the
pottery booth at the back. On reaching the booth
she stared around, anxious-eyed, hunting for the
mystery man. Oh, where was he? There wasn&rsquo;t
a sign of him anywhere. He&rsquo;d said he was always
around here at this time of day. What if
he should&rsquo;ve missed coming this day?</p>
<p>She walked slowly back of the booth and on
around to the front again, her eyes scanning
every man in sight. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not here,&rdquo; she told
herself finally, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t know where else to
go to look for him. Oh dear! The smugglers&rsquo;ll
get away again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>Just as she had reached this discouraging conclusion
a stalwart, olive-skinned man with a
dark mustache and black hat stepped up to her
side and said in a low tone, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t show your
surprise&mdash;I&rsquo;m the man you&rsquo;re looking for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mystery man! Jo Ann barely suppressed
a gasp of amazement. Disguised as a Mexican.
The same aquiline nose and gray eyes, but how
startlingly different he looked.</p>
<p>In almost an inaudible voice she told him as
quickly as she could about the smugglers being
on the way to the city.</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s eyes shone on hearing this news.
&ldquo;Good work. We&rsquo;ll follow them this time and
try to get the ringleaders of the gang as well as
those two. I must get word to my men right
away on both sides. You&rsquo;re still at the La Esperanza
Mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you know how I come out. Many
thanks for your help.&rdquo; With that the man rushed
off toward a side exit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>Feeling relieved and happy that she had succeeded
in delivering this message, Jo Ann
walked on to the front to look for the girls and
found them, as she had thought she would, buying
fruit and vegetables.</p>
<p>Peggy was the first to spy her. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
have to tell us you&rsquo;ve had success, Jo,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re smiling from ear to ear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to be that jubilant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a right to be happy,&rdquo; Florence said
warmly. &ldquo;Peg and I are glad, too, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Peggy and Florence selected the fruit
and vegetables, Jo Ann made the other purchases,
chiefly by means of the sign language, as
her Spanish was not sufficient for bargaining. As
soon as they had all finished their buying, Florence
found two small Mexican boys to carry
their piles of packages to the car. With the boys
at their heels they started out to the street, Florence
in the lead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>Just as she stepped out on the street, Florence
caught sight of the newsboy, his face and head
bleeding, almost surrounded by a crowd of people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious! What can have happened to the
poor child?&rdquo; she gasped as she ran toward him.</p>
<p>As soon as he saw Florence the newsboy began
explaining between sobs, &ldquo;Oh, se&ntilde;orita, two men&mdash;stole&mdash;your
car! I try to stop them&mdash;and one
of them&mdash;knock me down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that is terrible!&rdquo; Florence cried, at the
same time scrutinizing his wounds. &ldquo;Not deep,
but painful,&rdquo; she decided before going on to
question him about the appearance of the men.</p>
<p>Brokenly, the boy began describing the man
who had hit him. &ldquo;He had a scar&mdash;on his chin&mdash;and
one eye squinted&mdash;an evil eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds like the taller one of the smugglers,&rdquo;
Florence decided immediately. &ldquo;Was he
the taller one of the two men?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>S&iacute;.</i> I try to keep them&mdash;from stealing your
car, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; The boy stopped talking to sob
afresh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you tried,&rdquo; Florence comforted
him. &ldquo;Here is some money.&rdquo; She handed him
some coins and then a clean handkerchief, adding,
&ldquo;Wipe the blood with this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A tall professional-looking man stepped up
just then and remarked, &ldquo;I will look after the
boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a &ldquo;<i>Muchas gracias</i>&rdquo; and an &ldquo;<i>Adios</i>&rdquo; to
the boy, Florence hurried back to Jo Ann and
Peggy, who were standing near by, still wondering
what had happened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX
<br /><span class="small">MORE TROUBLES</span></h2>
<p>As soon as she drew near, Florence burst out
excitedly, &ldquo;Our car&rsquo;s stolen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann&rsquo;s and Peggy&rsquo;s eyes stretched to their
widest, and their lower jaws dropped.</p>
<p>Jo Ann was the first to recover from the shock.
&ldquo;Our car&rsquo;s stolen! Why, who could&rsquo;ve&mdash;&mdash;Oh,
it must&rsquo;ve been the smugglers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it was,&rdquo; Florence replied. &ldquo;The
newsboy described one of them exactly&mdash;the
taller one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy gasped audibly. &ldquo;That settles it, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hit the boy&mdash;knocked him down&mdash;then
they drove off in our car.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand why the smuggler
should&rsquo;ve hit the boy,&rdquo; put in Jo Ann bewilderedly.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;d the boy have to do with the
affair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence and Peggy exchanged glances, then
Florence answered, &ldquo;I hired the boy to watch
our car while we went to the market. The lock
on the car wouldn&rsquo;t work. I&rsquo;m to blame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;I&rsquo;m beginning to see now.&rdquo; The bewildered
expression on Jo Ann&rsquo;s face slipped away,
and a look of determination took its place.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get our car back right away.&rdquo; She
drew her brows together into a little frowning
line of concentration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better report it to the police?&rdquo;
Peggy asked.</p>
<p>Jo Ann shook her head. &ldquo;Not yet. Maybe
later. I believe we&rsquo;d better hunt up the mystery
man and tell&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She halted abruptly. &ldquo;But
maybe he&rsquo;s left the city already. I hope not. I
want to tell him our car&rsquo;s license number, so he
can follow it&mdash;especially since the smugglers
might&rsquo;ve discarded their car entirely. But maybe
one of them might drive ours and the other
one their car. Come on. We&rsquo;ll plan what to do
as we walk.&rdquo; She caught Florence with one hand
and Peggy with the other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But where&rsquo;re we going?&rdquo; queried Peggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anywhere so we can get away from this
crowd,&rdquo; Florence whispered, eying the curious
onlookers, who were waiting to see what the
<i>Americanas</i> were going to do.</p>
<p>No sooner had the girls started off down the
street than Florence remembered about the two
little boys carrying their packages. She glanced
around and saw them following close behind,
the packages piled up in their arms almost as
high as their chins. &ldquo;Gracious!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t have them following us everywhere.
We&rsquo;d better have them take the packages back
to the market and leave them there for a while.
Walk slowly, and I&rsquo;ll catch up with you in a
shake.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>She wheeled about, gave a quick order in
Spanish to the boys, and then accompanied
them to the market. After leaving the packages
at the same booth where they had waited before
and paying the boys a few <i>centavos</i>, she flew
back to the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve decided to go to the telephone exchange
first,&rdquo; Jo Ann announced to her quickly. &ldquo;Where
is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One block down, then turn to the right and
go about a block and a half.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s step on it.&rdquo; Jo Ann strode off in what
Peggy always called her &ldquo;long-legged gallop,&rdquo;
which meant that both she and Florence had to
take two or three steps to Jo Ann&rsquo;s one.</p>
<p>Having caught up with Jo Ann by running,
Florence asked, &ldquo;Why&mdash;are you&mdash;going to the
exchange?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause I feel sure that he was going to do
some long-distance phoning&mdash;and he started off
in this direction.&rdquo; With that she galloped off
faster than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People&rsquo;ll think we&rsquo;re crazy&mdash;running&mdash;along
like this,&rdquo; puffed Peggy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>Florence nodded assent &ldquo;They&rsquo;re saying,
&lsquo;Ah, those&mdash;queer <i>Americanas</i>!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two girls reached the exchange at last in
time for Florence to help Jo Ann question one
of the operators. The man they had described,
the operator replied, had left only a few minutes
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did he go?&rdquo; Jo Ann asked quickly.</p>
<p>The operator shook her head. &ldquo;That I do not
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now where?&rdquo; Peggy asked Jo Ann curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the telegraph office. He&rsquo;d probably have
to telegraph, too, to some of the inspectors.
Where&rsquo;s the telegraph office, Florence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go back to the corner where we just turned.
It&rsquo;s a block past the market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, gosh!&rdquo; Jo Ann exploded. &ldquo;Just my luck
to go to the wrong place first. Come on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>Off she rushed out of the building and soon
was several yards ahead of the other two. By the
time she had reached the telegraph office, she
was panting, her cheeks a brilliant scarlet with
beads of perspiration running down them.</p>
<p>Just as she dashed in, she bumped into a man
hurrying out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;I&mdash;beg your&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she began, then
gasped, &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s <i>you</i>! I&rsquo;ve&mdash;been hunting&mdash;for
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; the mystery man asked,
guiding her outside, away from the curious stare
of the people in the office.</p>
<p>As quickly as she could manage in her breathless
state, she recounted what had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad you found me in time,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I
was just ready to leave in pursuit. What&rsquo;s your
car&rsquo;s number?&rdquo; He jerked out a notebook from
his pocket and jotted down the number she gave
him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to get your car back to you,&rdquo; he
added then. &ldquo;About your getting home this
afternoon&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>He broke off in the middle of his sentence and
turned to the tall, erect Mexican man standing
back of him, whom Jo Ann now noticed for the
first time. &ldquo;Gonzales, I want you to drive this
girl and her friends to their home out beyond
San Geronimo. She&rsquo;ll tell you how to get there,
if you don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; He turned again to Jo Ann,
saying, &ldquo;This is Juan Gonzales, my right-hand
man; Gonzales, this is my right-hand girl, Miss
Jo Ann Cutrer. Take good care of her.&rdquo; He addressed
Jo Ann again: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a careful driver.
I&rsquo;ll write to you as soon as I can.&rdquo; With an
&ldquo;Adios&rdquo; he hurried on to the curb, sprang into a
tan roadster, and drove off rapidly.</p>
<p>By that time Peggy and Florence had come
puffing up, and after introducing Mr. Gonzales
to them, Jo Ann explained that he was to
drive them home. Florence, with her knowledge
of Mexicans and their language, talked for a
few minutes in Spanish with the stranger before
agreeing to this plan. Having decided that he
was a gentleman and trustworthy, she told Jo
Ann that she, for one, thought they ought to be
starting back home shortly. &ldquo;As soon as we get
our packages at the market, we&rsquo;ll be ready, won&rsquo;t
we?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have a few things I&rsquo;d like to get,&rdquo; spoke
up Peggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long will it take you to finish your
shopping?&rdquo; Mr. Gonzales asked in excellent
English, surprising them all so that there was a
moment&rsquo;s silence before Peggy answered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
be ready in about fifteen or twenty minutes. You
girls will be too, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both nodded assent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, I&rsquo;ll have Mr. Andrews&rsquo;s other
car here waiting by that time for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Andrews&rsquo;s car?&rdquo; Jo Ann repeated puzzledly,
then smiled. &ldquo;You mean the mystery
man&rsquo;s car. We&rsquo;ve called him the mystery man so
long that I&rsquo;d forgotten for the moment that he&rsquo;d
told me his name was Andrews. I&rsquo;ll try to remember
that hereafter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>The girls hurried off to finish their shopping
and in about a quarter of an hour were back at
the corner. Almost at the same minute Mr. Gonzales
drove up in a sedan, and the girls climbed
into the back seat, piling their packages on the
floor.</p>
<p>Jo Ann noted with satisfaction that Mr. Gonzales
was a careful driver, weaving in and out
the traffic with ease and taking no unnecessary
risks. Having arrived at this conclusion she relaxed
somewhat and began talking over their
exciting experiences with the girls. &ldquo;One thing
I&rsquo;m thankful for is that we three paid for Jitters
ourselves,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be
terrible if, say, Miss Prudence, had been a part
owner? Wouldn&rsquo;t you hate to tell her about the
car&rsquo;s having been stolen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both nodded emphatically, and Florence
added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been wondering if we&rsquo;d better tell
her. I rather think not. She&rsquo;d get all stirred up
over it, and besides, the mystery man&rsquo;ll probably
get Jitters back to us in a few days. How
about keeping quiet about it for a while?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in favor of keeping mum till we hear
from Mr. Andrews,&rdquo; Peggy put in. &ldquo;If he writes
he couldn&rsquo;t find the car, why, of course, we&rsquo;ll
have to tell Miss Prudence and Mr. Eldridge
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Jos&eacute; meets us at Jitters&rsquo; House this
afternoon,&rdquo; Jo Ann broke in, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll know something&rsquo;s
wrong at once. He&rsquo;ll want to know what&rsquo;s
become of Jitters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll tell him the truth and ask him to say
nothing about it for a few days&mdash;till we tell him
he may,&rdquo; Florence suggested. &ldquo;He already
knows about those men being angry at us for getting
the pottery they&rsquo;d planned to buy. That reminds
me, I feel mighty bad about losing that
pottery. I&rsquo;d written my friend I was shipping it,
and she&rsquo;ll be expecting it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Andrews may recover it when&mdash;or if&mdash;he
finds our car,&rdquo; Peggy remarked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly hope he recovers both the car and
the pottery,&rdquo; Jo Ann said with a sigh. &ldquo;When I
think of that gang of smugglers he&rsquo;s fighting&mdash;well,
I just get scared stiff. I&rsquo;m afraid they&rsquo;re
going to kill him before it&rsquo;s all over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try not to worry,&rdquo; advised Florence.</p>
<p>When they finally reached Jitters&rsquo; House,
they found Jos&eacute; waiting for them with the
horses. His black eyes widened in surprise on
seeing them getting out of a strange car.</p>
<p>After the girls had thanked Mr. Gonzales and
he had started off toward the city, Florence told
the mystified Jos&eacute; what had happened, ending,
&ldquo;Do not tell anyone about the car&rsquo;s having been
stolen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not tell,&rdquo; he promised.</p>
<p>As the rest of the family had finished eating
dinner by the time the girls had reached the
house, they ate alone and thus escaped being
questioned as much as they would have been
otherwise. Shortly afterward they went on to
their bedroom. So engrossed were they still in
talking over their adventures that it was late
before they could compose themselves and go to
sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>The next day lagged snail-like to the girls. All
three went about their household tasks with an
air of subdued suspense.</p>
<p>Over and over Jo Ann found herself wondering
about the mystery man. Was he still alive?
Perhaps even now he was lying badly injured&mdash;dying
in some remote gully in the desert. Had
that awful presentiment he&rsquo;d had about losing
his life&mdash;had it actually come to pass, or was it
about to? She shuddered at these gloomy
thoughts.</p>
<p>Noticing how worried Jo Ann looked, both
girls realized that it was the mystery man&rsquo;s fate
more than the loss of the car that was troubling
her. They both tried to take her mind off this
subject, and Peggy even tried a bit of teasing
finally in her effort to make her less pessimistic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going around here with such a long
face that your chin almost touches the floor,&rdquo;
she told her. &ldquo;Miss Prudence&rsquo;ll be wondering
what&rsquo;s the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s already asked me if you&rsquo;re sick, Jo,&rdquo;
Florence added. &ldquo;She said you looked so pale
and peaked that she&rsquo;d about decided she&rsquo;d
better give you some of her iron-strychnine
tonic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; Jo Ann ejaculated, grimacing.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the vilest-tasting stuff in the whole
world. I&rsquo;d better turn up the corners of my
mouth into a grin right now.&rdquo; In spite of these
words, her lower lip trembled threateningly as
she added, &ldquo;When you know some person&rsquo;s life
is in danger, you can&rsquo;t help thinking and worrying
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snap out of the dumps,&rdquo; Peggy ordered. &ldquo;I
hear Miss Prudence coming. I feel it in my
bones that she&rsquo;s bringing her bottle of tonic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann obediently tried to force her lips into
the semblance of a smile. Peggy&rsquo;s and Florence&rsquo;s
lips curved upward without any difficulty when
they saw Miss Prudence enter, actually carrying
a bottle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>Jo Ann eyed the bottle askance a moment;
then her face brightened into a real smile as she
read the label, &ldquo;Furniture Polish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You girls don&rsquo;t seem to know what to do
with yourselves this morning,&rdquo; Miss Prudence
said briskly, &ldquo;so I&rsquo;ve decided to give you some
extra work&mdash;polishing the furniture.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI
<br /><span class="small">WELCOME GUESTS</span></h2>
<p>The next morning the girls waited anxiously
for Jos&eacute; to return from his trip to the village
for the mail. They had wanted to go with him,
but Miss Prudence had vetoed that plan with,
&ldquo;The sun&rsquo;s so hot today, and Jo Ann&rsquo;s looking
so pale, that I believe you&rsquo;d better not take
that long horseback ride. I think I&rsquo;d better
begin giving her some of my iron-strychnine
tonic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann shook her head vigorously. &ldquo;Oh, no,
I don&rsquo;t need any tonic! Indeed I don&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t
waste any of your medicine on me. When it&rsquo;s
gone you&rsquo;d probably have to send back to the
States for some more.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll wait two or three days; then, if
you&rsquo;re not looking better by that time, you&rsquo;ll
have to take that tonic without fail.&rdquo; Miss Prudence&rsquo;s
voice was firm.</p>
<p>When the family sat down to eat their lunch,
Jos&eacute; had not yet returned from the village.</p>
<p>Noticing that Carlitos was not at the table,
Peggy inquired of Miss Prudence about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went with Jos&eacute; after the mail,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>No sooner had she finished her sentence than
Carlitos burst into the room, his blue eyes round
and dark in his excitement. With his Spanish
words tumbling over each other in his haste he
blurted out, &ldquo;Ah, senoritas, your automobile&mdash;it
is stolen. Terrible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not being able to understand him, Miss Prudence
and Peggy stared wonderingly. Jo Ann&rsquo;s
and Florence&rsquo;s faces, however, flamed scarlet
with embarrassment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cat&rsquo;s out of the bag now,&rdquo; flashed
through Jo Ann&rsquo;s mind. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to tell the
whole tale.&rdquo; She could feel Mr. Eldridge&rsquo;s eyes
boring into hers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>The next moment Miss Prudence ordered
sternly, &ldquo;Carlitos, speak English! Tell me what&rsquo;s
happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In halting English Carlitos repeated that the
girls&rsquo; car had been stolen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stolen!&rdquo; ejaculated Miss Prudence. &ldquo;What
next?&rdquo; She turned to her brother. &ldquo;Do you suppose
that Luis could&rsquo;ve stolen it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. The girls drove to the city after Luis
was taken prisoner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time Jo Ann had recovered her wits
sufficiently to say slowly, &ldquo;The car was stolen
when we were in the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My stars!&rdquo; Miss Prudence gasped. &ldquo;Why&mdash;why
didn&rsquo;t you tell us before this? The idea of
your not saying one word all this time! And
you might&rsquo;ve been stolen&mdash;kidnaped&mdash;yourselves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get so flustered, Prue,&rdquo; Mr. Eldridge
advised. &ldquo;The girls&rsquo;re safe and sound if their
car isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He looked over at Jo Ann. &ldquo;Begin
at the first and tell us exactly what happened.
Florence, you and Peggy put in all the details
she misses.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>Thus commanded, Jo Ann took a long breath
and plunged into the story, beginning at her first
anxiety over the mystery man&rsquo;s presentiment
about his going to be killed. From that she went
on to their discovery of the smugglers&rsquo; car in the
desert, their finding them in the village, and her
reporting all this to the mystery man.</p>
<p>Other than a few exclamations and gasps
Miss Prudence did not interrupt. But when Jo
Ann stopped to catch her breath, she threw in,
&ldquo;Well, after all this wild adventure, I&rsquo;ll be
afraid to let you girls stick your noses outside
the door. And here I&rsquo;d thought all this time I
was the perfect chaperon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The expression of stupefied amazement on his
sister&rsquo;s face made Mr. Eldridge smile half
whimsically and say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned not to be
amazed at anything this trio pulls off. There&rsquo;re
still several points not clear in my mind,
though.&rdquo; He began hurling question after question
at the girls, till each felt as if she were
being cross-examined on the witness stand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>Finally he was satisfied that he had gathered
together all the loose ends of the story. His face
was grave as he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s all turned
out as it has&mdash;so far, but hereafter don&rsquo;t get
tangled up in any way whatever with smugglers.
They&rsquo;re a dangerous set, as Mr. Andrews told
you. Most of them would as soon shoot our
officers as not. Indeed, they seem to look upon
them as good targets for their practice. The next
time you suspect anyone of being a smuggler,
come tell me about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So earnest and emphatic had Mr. Eldridge
been that for the first time Jo Ann realized fully
the risks she had been running. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m through
with smugglers and their affairs from now on,&rdquo;
she declared. &ldquo;I was more to blame for getting
mixed up in this than Peggy and Florence.
They&rsquo;d have kept out of it if it hadn&rsquo;t been for
me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>Florence spoke up promptly and began trying
to share the blame, but Jo Ann shook her
head. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m the guilty one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this well-deserved lecture Jo Ann felt
&ldquo;indigo blue,&rdquo; as she expressed it to the girls
afterward. &ldquo;If I could only hear from Mr. Andrews
that he&rsquo;s all right and that the smugglers
were caught and the car found!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day dragged on interminably, so it
seemed to Jo Ann in her low state of mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, cheer up, Jo,&rdquo; Peggy finally begged.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to get good news tomorrow, I feel
it in my bones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope your bones&rsquo;re trustworthy,&rdquo; Jo Ann
returned; &ldquo;but I have my doubts about their
power to prophesy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the morning of the fourth day Jo Ann
woke in a more cheerful mood. &ldquo;I believe we&rsquo;re
going to hear from Mr. Andrews today,&rdquo; she
told the girls.</p>
<p>Peggy smiled. &ldquo;Your bones must be getting
prophetic, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>When Jos&eacute; appeared at noon with a letter
from Mr. Andrews, Peggy and Florence were
quite as excited as Jo Ann.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up!&rdquo; Peggy implored, as Jo Ann began
to open it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read it out loud&mdash;hurry!&rdquo; urged Florence.</p>
<p>In another moment Jo Ann had unfolded the
letter. &ldquo;Why, it has only three lines in it! It just
says, &lsquo;All is well. Am bringing your car Saturday
afternoon to San Geronimo. Hope to get
there by four o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann&rsquo;s face was beaming by this time. &ldquo;Just
think! He&rsquo;s all right&mdash;and so&rsquo;s Jitters!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gr-and!&rdquo; chimed in Peggy, catching Jo Ann
and Florence by the hands and circling about
in lively dancing steps.</p>
<p>While they were still whirling about, Miss
Prudence entered the room.</p>
<p>Jo Ann checked her fast-flying feet and sang
out, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve swell, elegant news! The mystery
man&rsquo;s alive, and he&rsquo;s bringing our car to the village
this afternoon&mdash;about four o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m certainly glad to hear that!&rdquo; Miss
Prudence exclaimed. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see&mdash;if he reaches
the village that late, he&rsquo;ll probably come on out
here. We must have a good dinner for him.
That&rsquo;s fine of him, bringing your car all that
distance. Suppose you girls come to the kitchen
and help me awhile. I&rsquo;ll see that he gets some
good New England cooking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann grinned. &ldquo;That lets us girls out. We&rsquo;re
from the South.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Prudence came back promptly with,
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all good help just the same. Come
along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three girls followed her to the kitchen
and were soon busy helping her prepare the
salad and dessert. So diligently did they work
that they had finished before it was time for
Jos&eacute; to go to the village with the horses for the
two men to ride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go with Jos&eacute;,&rdquo; Jo Ann suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed Peggy and Florence.</p>
<p>All three hurried off at once to change into
their riding outfits.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</div>
<p>When, about two hours later, they came in
sight of Pedro&rsquo;s store, Jo Ann&rsquo;s sharp eyes spied
two cars in front of the building. &ldquo;One of the
cars is a brand-new one. A beauty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s Mr. Andrews&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Peggy suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That other one&rsquo;s his, I know. I wonder
where he&rsquo;s parked Jitters. I don&rsquo;t see her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope nothing has happened to her,&rdquo; put in
Florence.</p>
<p>With their faces lit by the broadest smiles,
the three sprang from their horses and greeted
Mr. Andrews, who had hurried out to meet
them, Mr. Gonzales following closely behind
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re so happy you&rsquo;re safe and sound&mdash;that
you&rsquo;re both all right!&rdquo; Jo Ann welcomed
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We certainly are, too, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; added
Peggy.</p>
<p>Florence nodded. &ldquo;Yes, indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did you capture the smugglers&mdash;all of
them?&rdquo; Jo Ann asked eagerly in the next breath.</p>
<p>Mr. Andrews smiled. &ldquo;Not all of them; but
the three ringleaders and the two whose trail
you set me following are behind prison bars.
That gang&rsquo;s broken to bits; I can breathe more
freely now. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for you, I might
be dead. I&rsquo;m certainly grateful to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann drew a long sigh of relief, as did the
other two girls. &ldquo;That certainly is grand news,&rdquo;
she added the next moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope that&rsquo;s the last experience you girls&rsquo;ll
ever have of that kind,&rdquo; he said earnestly.</p>
<p>A moment&rsquo;s silence fell; then Jo Ann asked,
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Jitters?&rdquo; Suddenly recalling that
neither man knew the name of their car, she
added, smiling, &ldquo;Our old Ford, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men exchanged smiles before Mr.
Andrews answered, &ldquo;Jitters is a complete wreck&mdash;in
a deep gully near the border.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A look of utter bewilderment appeared on the
face of each girl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">[253]</div>
<p>In another moment Jo Ann recovered sufficiently
to say haltingly, &ldquo;But&mdash;you wrote&mdash;you
were bringing our car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did bring it. There it is!&rdquo; Mr. Andrews
gestured to the shining new car. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a present
for the assistance you girls have given us&mdash;to
take the place of your Jitters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three pairs of eyes flew open to their widest.
So overwhelming was their amazement that for
once none of them could speak for a full minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have done much for us,&rdquo; Mr. Gonzales
spoke up, smiling. &ldquo;You have probably saved
my life as well as Mr. Andrews&rsquo;s. <i>Muchas gracias</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but, Mr. Andrews&mdash;Mr. Gonzales,&rdquo;
began Jo Ann confusedly. &ldquo;We do not deserve
this fine new car. You must not give us such
a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have more than earned it,&rdquo; smiled Mr.
Andrews. &ldquo;It is yours by rights. We owe you
more than we can ever repay you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Convinced at last that the car was rightfully
theirs, the girls began to exclaim delightedly:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">[254]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Grand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gorgeous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand thanks from each one of us,&rdquo;
added Jo Ann, shining-eyed.</p>
<p>With that the three of one accord ran over to
the car to inspect it and revel in its beauty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll feel so elegant&mdash;so swanky, riding
about in this car!&rdquo; exclaimed Jo Ann.</p>
<p>They climbed inside then to admire the upholstery
and shining gadgets.</p>
<p>A few minutes later Jo Ann was proudly
driving out of the village, the two men following
in the other car, and Jos&eacute; with the aid of a
small boy bringing along the horses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t Miss Prudence and Mr. Eldridge be
surprised when they hear about our new car?&rdquo;
Peggy remarked.</p>
<p>Jo Ann smiled broadly. &ldquo;Miss Prudence was
always scared of Jitters. She&rsquo;ll be delighted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we name it?&rdquo; Florence asked a
moment later.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">[255]</div>
<p>Peggy suddenly chuckled. &ldquo;How about naming
it for Miss Prudence? It&rsquo;s so shining and
spotlessly clean. And besides, that name might
help Jo to be more prudent&mdash;less reckless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That name suits me,&rdquo; laughed Jo Ann.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And me,&rdquo; added Florence. &ldquo;And I believe
it&rsquo;ll please Miss Prudence, especially when we
explain why we&rsquo;ve chosen the name.&rdquo;</p>
